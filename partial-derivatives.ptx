    <title>Definition</title>
    <p>
      The first of several generalizations of derivatives is the
      partial derivative.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m> be a scalar function.
          If <m>x</m> is one of the variable, then the derivative of
          <m>f</m> which pretend that all other variables are constant
          is called the <term>partial derivative</term> of <m>f</m> in
          the variable <m>x</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The notation for partial derivatives resembles Leibniz notation
      for ordinary derivatives: <m>\frac{df}{dx}</m>. Leibniz style
      notation is useful since the variable of differentiation is
      explicit. The partial derivatives of <m>f</m> in terms of
      <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, <m>z</m>, or <m>x_i</m> are written with a
      stylized version of <m>d</m> in Leibniz notation.
      <me>
        \frac{\del f}{\del x} \frac{\del f}{\del y} \frac{\del f}{\del
        z} \frac{\del f}{\del x_1}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      For interpretation, this gives us the rate of change of <m>f</m>
      with respect to one of its variables. We don't have a holisitic
      notion of rate of change, but we can see how it changes in each
      variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we wanted to be formal, pretending that all the other
      variales are constant is the same as taking limits in one
      variable. For <m>f: \RR^2 \rightarrow \RR</m>, these limits
      defined the two partial derivatives.

          \frac{\del f}{\del x} (a,b) \amp = \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow
          (a,b)} \frac{ f(a+h, b) - f(a,b)}{h}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \frac{\del f}{\del y} (a,b) \amp = \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow
          (a,b)} \frac{ f(a, b+h) - f(a,b)}{h}
        </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that the value of <m>\frac{\del f}{\del x}</m> still
      depends on <m>y</m>. Different <m>y</m> values identify
      different point in the domain, where the rate of change with
      respect to <m>x</m> may differ.

    <title>Differentiability</title>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m> is
          <term>differentiable</term> at
          <m>(a_1, a_2, \ldots,
          a_n)</m> if <term>all</term> of its partial derivatives
          <m>\frac{\del f}{\del x_i}</m> exists at that point.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      As we did for single-variable calculus, we use
      <m>\frac{\del}{\del x}</m> and similar expressions as operators
      <mdash/> the things that take derivatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are various notational conventions for partial
      derivatives. In addition to <m>\frac{\del f}{\del x}</m>, we
      can also write this as <m>f_x</m>, <m>\del_x f</m> and <m>D_x
      f</m>. The first of these is a nice short-hand which we will
      use frequently.

          In addition, we can mix the partial derivatives, first
          taking the partial in <m>x</m> and the in <m>y</m> or
          vice-versa.

              f}{\del y \del x} = 18x^2y - 4y^3 + 4xy

          Curiously, we get the same answer from either order of the
          mixed partial derivatives. This equality is true in general
          and is called Clairaut's Theorem. In the statement of the
          proposition, notice the requirement that the domain is an
          open set. This is an example of the topological conditions
          invovled in multivariable calculus.
