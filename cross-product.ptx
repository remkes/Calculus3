  <title>The Cross Product</title>
  <p>
    The dot product is an operation which can be performed on any two vectors in <m>\RR^n</m> for any <m>n \geq 1</m>.
    There are no other conventional products that work in all dimensions.
    However, there is a special product that works in three dimensions.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>u</m> = <img src="MISSINGFILE"  width="400" /> and <m>v</m> = <img src="MISSINGFILE"  width="400" /> be two vectors in <m>\RR^3</m>.
        The <term>cross product</term> of <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> is written
        <m>u \times v</m> and defined by this formula:
        <me>
          u \times v = \begin{pmatrix}u_2v_3 - u_3v_2\\u_3v_1 - u_1v_3\\u_1v_2 - u_2v_1\end{pmatrix}
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>

    The cross product differs from the dot product in several important ways.
    First, it produces a new vector in <m>\RR^3</m>, not a scalar.
    For this reason, when working in <m>\RR^3</m>,
    the dot product is often refered to as the <em>scalar product</em>
    and the cross product as the <em>vector product</em>.
    Second, the dot product measures,
    in some sense, the similarity of two vectors.
    The cross product measures, in some sense,
    the difference between two vectors.
    The cross product has greater magnitude if the vectors are closer to being perpendicular.
    If <m>\theta</m> is the angle between <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>,
    the dot product was expressed in terms of <m>\cos \theta</m>.
    This measures similarity, since <m>\cos 0 = 1</m>.
    There is a similar identity for the cross product.
    <me>
      |u \times v| = |u||v| \sin \theta
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    This identity tells us that the cross product measures difference in direction,
    since <m>\sin 0 = 0</m>.
    In particular, this tells us that <m>|u \times u| = 0</m>,
    implying that <m>u \times u = 0</m>
    (the zero vector is the only vector which has zero length).
  </p>
  <p>
    We can calculate a combination of the dot and cross products.
    <md>
      <mrow>u \cdot (u \times v) \amp  = \begin{pmatrix}u_1</mrow>
      <mrow>u_2</mrow>
      <mrow>u_3\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}u_2v_3 - u_3v_2</mrow>
      <mrow>u_3v_1 - u_1v_3</mrow>
      <mrow>u_1v_2 - u_2v_1\end{pmatrix}</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp  = u_1u_2v_3 - u_1u_3v_2 + u_2u_3v_1 - u_2u_1v_3 + u_3u_1v_2 - u_3u_2v_1 = 0</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    A similar calculation shows that <m>v \cdot (u \times v) = 0</m>.
    Since a dot product of two vectors is zero if and only if the vectors are perpendicular,
    the vector <m>v \times u</m> is perpendicular to both <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>.
    This property turns out to be very useful for describing planes in <xref ref="calculus-of-parametric-curves">Sections</xref>
    and <xref ref="tangent-planes"></xref>.
    There are two other identities for the cross product that we will use in <xref ref="multivariable-functions">Chapter</xref>,
    which we state here without proof.

    An important application of the cross product is describing rotational motion.
    Linear mechanics describes the motion of an object through space but rotational mechanics describes the rotation of an object independently of its movement through space.
    A force on an object can cause both kinds of movement,
    obviously.
    The table below summarizes the parallel questions of linear motion and rotational motion in <m>\RR^3</m>.

    How do we describe torque?
    If there is a linear force applied to an object which can only rotate around an axis,
    and if the linear force is applied at a distance <m>r</m> from the axis,
    we can think of the force <m>F</m> and the distance <m>r</m> as vectors.
    The torque is then <m>\tau = r \times F</m>.
    Notice that <m>|\tau| = |r||F| \sin \theta</m>,
    indicating that linear force perpendicular to the radius gives the greatest angular acceleration.
    That makes sense.
    If <m>F</m> and <m>r</m> are colinear,
    that means we are pushing directly along the axis and no rotation can occur.
  </p>
  <p>
    The use of cross products in rotational dynamics is extended in many interesting ways.
    In fluid dynamics,
    local rotational products of the fluid result in turbulence,
    helicity, vorticity and similar effects.
    Tornadoes and hurricanes are particularly extreme examples of vortices and helices in the fluid which is the atmosphere.
    All the descriptions of the force and motion of these vortices involve cross products in the vectors describing the fluid.
