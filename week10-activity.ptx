          Calculate the directional derivative of the function
          <me>
            f(x,y) = 3x + 5y - 2xy + x^2 - y^2 
          </me>

          Our method of calculating directional derivatives is to take
          the dot product of the <emph>unit</emph> direction vector
          with the gradient of the function. First we calculate the
          gradient.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \nabla f(x,y) \amp = 
            </mrow>
          </md>
          Then we calculate the unit vector for the given direction.

              \frac{1}{|v|}v \amp = ()
            </mrow>
          </md>
          Then we take the dot product to produce the directional
          derivative.

              D_v f(x,y) \amp = \frac{1}{|v|} v \cdot \nabla f(x,y) = 
            </mrow>
          </md>
          Finally, we evaluate at the given point.

          We could have first evaluated the gradient at the point and
          then taken the dot product with the unit direction; that
          order of calculations would have produced the same result.

          Describe the shape of the curves and qualitatively argue

          Calculate the equation of the tangent plane to the function

          We can use the direct form of the equation. To use that
          form, we need the value of the function at the point as well
          as the value of its partial derivatives at the point.
