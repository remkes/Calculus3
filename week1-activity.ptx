    <title>Testing Series for Convergence</title>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Test this series for convergence.
          <me>
            \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{4}{1+n} 
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          These terms are positive and asymptotically equivalent to
          <m>\frac{1}{n}</m>, which are the terms of the harmonic
          series (or the <m>\zeta</m> series with <m>p=1</m>. The
          harmonic series is a divergent series, so by asymptotic
          comparison, this is also a divergence series.

          Test this series for convergence.
          <me>
            \sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^n 5^{-n}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          This is an alternating series, so we can use the alternating
          series test. Look at the limit of the term.
          <me>
            \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} 5^{-n} = \lim_{n \rightarrow
            \infty} \frac{1}{5^n} = 0 
          </me>
          The terms approach zero, so by the alternating series test,
          this series is convergent.

          Test this series for convergence.

            \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1 + 2^n + 4^n}{7^n}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We can split this up into three series by linearity.
          <me>
            \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1 + 2^n + 4^n}{7^n} = 
            \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{7^n} + \frac{2^n}{7^n} +
            \frac{4^n}{7^n} = 
            \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{7} \right)^n + 
            \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left( \frac{2}{7} \right)^n + 
            \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^n
          </me>
          All three of these are geometric series with common ratios
          less than one, so each of the three is convergent. Our
          series is the sum of three convergent series, so it is
          convergent. Since these are all geometric series, we can
          actually calculate the value of this series.

              \amp \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{7} \right)^n + 
              \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left( \frac{2}{7} \right)^n + 
              \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^n

            <mrow>
              \amp = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{7}} + \frac{1}{1 -
              \frac{2}{7}} + \frac{1}{1 - \frac{4}{7}} = \frac{7}{6} +
              \frac{7}{5} + \frac{7}{3} = \frac{49}{10}

            \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{n^2} +
            \frac{1}{n^3} \right)

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Since we are adding positive elements to <m>\frac{1}{n}</m>,
          the term here satisfy this inequatily. 
          <me>
            \left( \frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{n^2} +
            \frac{1}{n^3} \right) > \frac{1}{n} 
          </me>
          The terms are positive and greater than the terms of the
          harmonic series, which is a divergent series with positive
          terms. By direct comparison, this series diverges.

            \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\sqrt{n^6 + 1}}{n^3} 
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We can use the test for divergence here and look at the
          limit of the terms.
          <me>
            \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\sqrt{n^6 + 1}}{n^3} 
          </me>
          In this limit, the asymptotic order of the numerator and
          denominator are both <m>n^3</m> and the leading coefficient
          are both 1. 
          <me>
            \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\sqrt{n^6 + 1}}{n^3} =
            \frac{1}{1} = 1 
          </me>
          Since the limit of the terms is not zero, this is a
          divergent series.

      <solution>
        <p>
          We can use the ratio test here to deal with the factorial.

            <mrow>
              \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left| \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}
              \right| \amp = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}
              \frac{\frac{e^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}}{\frac{e^n}{n!}} 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}
              \frac{e^{n+1} (n)!}{e^n (n+1)!} 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{e}{n+1} = 0
            </mrow>
          </md>
          The limit is 0, which is less than 1, so the ratio test
          tells us that the series is convergent.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We could use ratio test here for the factorials, but we can
          more directly simplify these terms. 
          <me>
            \frac{(n+5!)}{n+7)!} = \frac{(n+5)!}{(n+7)(n+6)(n+5)!} =
            \frac{1}{(n+6)(n+7)} = \frac{1}{n^2 + 13n + 42}
          </me>
          Now these terms are asymptotically equivalent to
          <m>\frac{1}{n^2}</m>, which are the terms of the
          <m>\zeta</m> series with <m>p=2</m>, a convergent
          <m>\zeta</m> series. Since our series has positive terms
          which asymptotically equivalent to a positive convergent
          series, our series is also convergent.

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Ther terms here are asymptotically equivalent to
          <m>\frac{1}{n}</m>. Even though there are negative signs,
          for <m>n</m> sufficiently large (<m>n \geq 5</m> is already
          enough), both numerator and denominator will be negative, so
          the term are positive. Therefore, we have positive terms
          which are asymptotically equivalent to the positive terms of
          the harmonic series. Since the harmonic series is divergent,
          our series is also divergent.

          The term <m>\frac{n+1}{n}</m> approaches 1 by asymptotic
          analysis, so this limit approaches <m>\frac{1}{3}</m>. This
          is less than one, to the ratio test tells us that the limit

          The terms of this series are asymptotically equivalent to

          series converge when <m>p > 1</m>, so our series has terms
          which are asymptotically equivalent to a convergent
          <m>\zeta</m> series; therefore our series converges.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          This is a very strange series and it isn't obvious what test
          might help. I found a comparison that works. For large
          enough <m>n</m>, <m>\ln n \gt 2</m>. If we invert this, we see
          that <m>\frac{1}{\ln n} \lt \frac{1}{2}</m>. Then if we
          apply the exponent <m>n</m>, we get 
          <me>
            \frac{1}{(\ln n)^n} \lt \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n 
          </me>
          This shows that the terms of this series are smaller than
          the terms <m>\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n</m>, which are the
          terms of a convergent geometric series (since the common
          ratio, <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>, is less than 1). Since all the
          terms of our series and the comparison series are positive,
          since we have terms which are smaller than the terms of a
          convergent series, our series will also converge. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, the root test is quite effective here (though
          I completely forgot about it while looking for the
          comparison above). 
          <me>
            \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sqrt[n]{ \left| \frac{1}{(\ln
            n)^n} \right| } = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{\ln
            n} = 0 
          </me>
          Since this limits exists and is less than <m>1</m>, the root
          test tells us that the series converges.
