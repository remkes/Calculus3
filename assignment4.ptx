        Assume that two particles have the following paths, both
        starting at <m>t=0</m>. Prove that the two particle collides,
        and find their speeds at the time of collision. (6)

          \gamma_1(t) = (0, t^2, t^3) \hspace{3cm}
          \gamma_2(t) = (\sin 2\pi t, 4 t, (2t-6)^6)

        For the two following curves, calculate the vectors <m>T(t),
        N(t)</m> and <m>B(t)</m> as well as the speed, curvature and
        torsion. Use these to qualitatively descripe the motion.

        Consider a function <m>I(m,t,p,d)</m> which describes the
        total amount of interest paid over the whole course of a
        mortgage, given that <m>m</m> is the original loan in dollars,
        <m>t</m> is the ammortization period in years, <m>p</m> is the
        interest rate in percentage (compounded yearly) and <m>d</m>
        is the monthly payment rate. Considering this a function of
        four variables, answer the following questions. (8)
        <ol>
          <li><p>
            What is the domain of the function. (You should impose
            reasonable practical limits on domain, as well as
            mathematically necessary limits).
          </p></li>
          <li><p>
            What is the range of the function?
          </p></li>
          <li><p>
            Does the function increase or decrease in each of the
            variables?

        Consider a function <m>L(p,\theta,v)</m> which describe the
        lift of an airplane, given that <m>p</m> is the air pressure,
        <m>\theta</m> is the angle of the wing flaps, and <m>v</m> is
        the speed of the plane. Considering this a function of three
        variables, answer the following questions. (8)
