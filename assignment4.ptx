        Assume that two particles have the following paths, both
        starting at <m>t=0</m>. Prove that the two particles collide,
        and find their speeds at the time of collision. (6)

            \amp \gamma_1(t) = (t^2 + 6, 3t, t-2)

        For the following curve, calculate the vectors <m>T(t),
        N(t)</m> and <m>B(t)</m> as well as the speed, curvature and
        torsion. Use these to qualitatively describe the motion.

        Choose a situation of a flycatcher chasing a mosquoto, a
        jet-fighter dogfight, or something similar with three
        dimensional motion. (Feel free to be creative in coming up
        with a scenario here.) Describe the motion of both parties in
        terms of curves with speed, curvature and torsion. (You don't
        need specific algebraic descriptions of specific curves.
        Instead, use speed, curvature and torsion to describe,
        qualitatively, what the curves would be doing. No calculations
        are required.) (4)

        Consider a function <m>C(t,h,w,c)</m> which describes 
        human comfort in an environment where <m>t</m> is the
        temperature, <m>h</m> is the humidity, <m>w</m> is the
        windspeed and <m>c</m> is the percentage of the sky which is
        cloudy. (Feel free to make units where necessary.) Consider
        this a function of four variables, answer the following
        questions. (8) 
        <ol>
          <li><p>
            What is the domain of the function. (You should impose
            reasonable practical limits on domain, as well as
            mathematically necessary limits).
          </p></li>
          <li><p>
            What is the range of the function?
          </p></li>
          <li><p>
            Does the function increase or decrease in each of the
            variables?

        Consider a function <m>p(t,o,l,s)</m> measuring the population
        of a large fish species in an ecosystem, where <m>t</m> is the
        water temperature, <m>o</m> is oxygen concentration,
        <m>l</m> is the population of a little fish species which is
        a food source, and <m>s</m> is the population of a shark
        species which is a predator. Considering this as a function of
        four variables, answer the following questions. (8)

            What is the domain of the function. (You should impose
