    Loci can also be defined via dot products.
    Consider, again, the general linear equation in <m>\RR^n</m>.
    <me>
      a_1 u_1 + a_2 u_2 + \ldots + a_n u_n = c
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's think of the variables <m>u_i</m> as the components of a variable vector <m>u \in \RR^n</m>.
    We also have <m>n</m> scalars <m>a_i</m> which we can treat as a constant vector <m>a \in \RR^n</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then we can re-write the linear equation with dot products.
    <me>
      a_1 u_1 + a_2 u_2 + \ldots + a_n u_n = \begin{pmatrix}a_1\\a_2\\\vdots\\a_n\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}u_1\\u_2\\\vdots\\u_n\end{pmatrix} = a \cdot u = c
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    In this way,
    a linear equation specifies a certain dot product value (<m>c</m>) with a fixed vector
    (<m>a</m>).
    A plane in <m>\RR^3</m> is given by the equation <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> . The plane is precisely all vectors whose dot product with the vector <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> is the fixed number <m>c</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If <m>c=0</m>,
    then we get <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> . A linear plane is the set of all vectors which are perpendicular to a fixed vector <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> .
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>P</m> be a plane in <m>\RR^3</m> determined by the equation <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> . The vector <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> is called the
        <term>normal to the plane</term>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>H</m> be a hyperplane in <m>\RR^n</m> determined by the equation
        <men>
          u \cdot a = \begin{pmatrix}u_1\\u_2\\\vdots\\u_n\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}a_1\\a_2\\\vdots\\a_n\end{pmatrix} = c
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        The vector <m>a</m> is called the
        <term>normal to the hyperplane</term>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    If <m>c=0</m>,
    the plane or hyperplane is perpendicular to the normal.
    This notion of orthogonality still works when <m>c \neq 0</m>.
    In this case, the normal is a <em>local</em>
    perpendicular direction from a point on the affine plane.
    Treating any such point as a local origin,
    the normal points in a direction perpendicular to all the
    <em>local direction</em>
    vectors which lie on the plane.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now we can build a general process for finding the equation of a plane in <m>\RR^3</m>.
    Any time we have a point <m>p</m> on the plane and two
    <em>local direction vectors</em>
    <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> which remain on the plane,
    we can find a normal to the plane by taking <m>u \times v</m>.
    Then we can find the equation of the plane by taking the dot product
    <m>p \cdot (u \times v)</m> to find the constant <m>c</m>.
    <men>
      \begin{pmatrix}x\\y\\z\end{pmatrix} \cdot (u \times v) = c
    </men>
  </p>
  <p>
    If we are given three points on a plane (<m>p</m>, <m>q</m> and <m>r</m>),
    then we can use <m>p</m> as the local origin and construct the local direction vectors as <m>q-p</m> and <m>r-p</m>.
    The normal is <m>(q-p) \times (r-p)</m>.
    In this way,
    we can construct the equation of a plane given three points or a single point and two local directions.
