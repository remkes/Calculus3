          Draw the following loci described in polar coordinates.
          (This is mostly by inspection. Try out some points and use
          the ideas and definitions of polar cooridinates to extend
          those points to a curve.)

          I start with <m>\theta = 0</m>, and then I see what happens
          to the radius as <m>\theta</m> increases or decreases. As
          the angle grows, the radius grows quadratically. This should
          give a spiral going out at the angle increases, and a
          mirrored spiral also going out as the angle decreases (since
          the negative angle will give a positive radius when
          squared). The double spiral result is shown in <xref
          ref="figure-activity-polar-locus-1" />

          </figure>
          To do the conversion, I simply replace the various pieces
          (<m>r</m> and <m>\theta</m>) with the corresponding cartesian
          equivalents.

          I could look for simplifications if I wished to, but nothing
          obviously makes the equations more succinct as far as I can
          tell.

        <p>
          The locus only depends on <m>r</m>, so <m>\theta</m> can
          take any possible value. In polar coordinates, this should
          produce circles: shapes where the radius is fixed by the
          angle is arbitrary. This is a quadratic in the radius with
          roots <m>r=2</m> and <m>r=5</m>, so there are two cirles, one
          with radius 2 and one with radius 5.

          To do the converse, I simply replace <m>r</m> with its cartesian

          There may be simplifications that can be made, but I don't
          see anything that would obviously make the locus more
          succinct.

          First I notice that the left side is positive, so the
          right side must also be positive; therefore, <m>\theta</m>
          is restricted to positive angles. Starting at <m>\theta = 0
          </m> and rotating counterclockwise, the radius grows with
          the angle as <m>r = \sqrt{\theta}</m>. Therefore, I expect
          a spiral with curves slowly getting closer and closer to each
          other as it expands, since the square root function is
          slower than linear growth (which would be an evently spaced
          spiral).

          I can re-arrange this equation into <m>r = -/theta</m>,
          which is the negative of the archimedian spiral. Since the
          radius must be positive, the angle must be negative, so we
          get a clockwise archimedian spiral. Since the growth is
          linear, the arms of the spiral are equally spaced.

          This locus only has one point, which is the origin. This
          point happens when <m>\theta = -1</m> and <m>r=0</m>. For
          all other values of <m>/theta</m>, the right side is
          negative. The the radius cannot be negative, there are no
          possible radius values that satisfy the equation. I can
          still translate this locus, thought the cartesian locus is
          still a complicated way of simply referring to the point
          <m>(0,0)</m>.

          This is nicely set up, since the cartesian locus includes
          the term <m>x^2 + y^2</m>, which directly translates to the
          polar term <m>r^2</m>. Making that replacement gives the
          polar locus.

          This cartesian locus is in a convenient form. The artcangent
          term is precisely the cartesian equivalent of the polar
          <m>\theta</m>. If I write <m>(-x^2 - y^2</m> as
          <m>-(x^2+y^2)</m>, I can also remember the fact that <m>(x^2 +
          y^2)</m> is equivalent to the polar <m>r^2</m>. Making those
          two replacements produces the polar locus.

          I could try to simplify if I wanted. One might be tempted
          to cancel an <m>r</m> term from both sides of the equations.
          That would be mostly fine, but there is one tricky subtlety.
          With the equation as written, the origin (with <m>r=0</m>
          and <m>\theta</m> undetermined) satisfies the equation; if
          I cancel <m>r</m> from both sides, I preserve the rest of
          the locus but I lose the origin. Therefore, the
          simplification of cancelling out <m>r</m> needs to be
          accompanied by a note for the case <m>r=0</m> and the
          inclusion of the origin.

              vector valued function: for each person, three values
              are given as output. This is not a geometric vector, but
              it can still be represented as a triple: (age, height,

              This is not a vector-valued function. It depends on
