  <title>Series as Functions</title>
  <p>
    Our two main examples for comparison in the previous chapter were the geometric series and the <m>\zeta</m> series.
    Both converged for certain values of the parameter;
    <m>|r|\lt 1</m> for the geometric series and <m>p ></m> for the <m>\zeta</m> series.
    To start this section, I'd like to re-interpret these two series.
    Instead of thinking of a whole family of different series which depend on a parameter (<m>r</m> or <m>p</m>),
    we can think of each family of series as a
    <em>function</em> of the parameter.
    In this view, we have only one series,
    but the series produces a function instead of just a number.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the geometric series,
    this new perspective defines a function <m>f(x)</m>.
    <me>
      f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    The domain of this function is <m>|x|\lt 1</m>,
    since those are the values of the parameter
    (now the variable)
    where the geometric series converges.
    We even know what this function is:
    <me>
      f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n = \frac{1}{1-x} \hspace{2cm} |x| \lt  1
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    In this way,
    the geometric series now defines the function <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}</m>.
    The domain restriction of the function is determined by the convergence of the series:
    a point <m>x</m> is in the domain of the function if the series converges for that choice of <m>x</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can do the same with the <m>\zeta</m> series.
    The reason we called them <m>\zeta</m> series is that the associated function is called the Riemann <m>\zeta</m>-function.
    <me>
      \zeta(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n^x}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    The domain of this function is <m>(1,\infty)</m>,
    since that is where the series converges.
    (In other branches of mathematics,
    the domain of <m>\zeta</m> is extended in new and interesting ways.
    The vanishing of the <m>\zeta</m> function is the subject of the famous Riemann Hypothesis,
    an important unsolved problem in modern mathematics.)
  </p>
  <p>
    In general, an infinite series can represent a function <m>f(x)</m> when the terms <m>a_n</m> of the series also depend on <m>x</m>.
    <me>
      f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n(x)
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Notice that the variable of the function, <m>x</m>,
    is not the index of the sum <m>n</m>.
    These two numbers are different and must not be confused.
    The domain of this function is the set of values of <m>x</m> for which the series converges.
    Instead of previous domain restrictions,
    involving division by zero,
    square roots and other problems,
    domain restrictions are now all about convergence.
    For these series, convergence is no longer a yes/no question.
    Instead, it is a domain question:
    for which real numbers does the series converge?
