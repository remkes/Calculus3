  <title>What Is Topology</title>
    <p>
      Topology is a branch of mathematics which studies concepts of
      shape, near-ness and distance. You might think that such a
      study woulds just be geometry, and you would be partially
      correct. Topology is like a coarser version of geometry. It
      cares about broad notions of near and far instead of precise
      distances, and about types of shapes instead of precisely
      defined specifics. Though it lacks the precision of other parts
      of geometry, it is fundamental to modern mathematics.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have already seen some topology of <m>\RR</m> in single
      variable calculus, mostly notably in the definition of open and
      closed intervals: <m>(a,b)</m> and <m>[a,b]</m>. Open intervals
      did not include their endpoints but closed intervals did.
      Openness and closedness are central to topolgoy. In this brief
      chapter, we will extend the notions of opennes, closedness and
      intervals to <m>\RR^n</m>. We will need these notions to
      understand multivariable functions in the next section.

    <title>Open and Closed Sets</title>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>S</m> be a set. A <term>topology</term> on <m>S</m>
          is a choice of subsets which are open and which subsets are
          closed.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      We need two definitions to allow us to define open and clsoed
      sets in <m>\RR^n</m>.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>\RR^n</m>. A point <m>a \in
          A</m> is called an <term>interior point</term> if there
          exists <m>\epsilon > 0</m> such that all points <m>b</m>
          with <m>|a-b|\lt \epsilon</m> are also in <m>A</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      A point is an interior point if all nearby points are also in
      the set. Around an interior point, we can move a little bit in
      any direction and remain inside the set. This <m>\epsilon</m>
      measures exactly how little the little bit of movement is.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>\RR^n</m>. A point <m>a</m>
          (not necessarily in the set) is called a <term>boundary
          point</term> if for any <m>\epsilon > 0</m> there exists
          points <m>b_1</m> and <m>b_2</m> such that both <m>|b_i -
          a|\lt \epsilon</m>, <m>b_1</m> is in the set, but <m>b_2</m>
          isn't. The <term>boundary</term> of a set is the set of all
          its boundary point.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      A point is a boundary point if there are nearby points in the
      set and nearby points not in the set. Nearby means within some
      small distance, measured by the small positive number
      <m>\epsilon</m>. The two definitions are mutually exclusive: a
      point cannot be both an interior and a boundary point for a set.
      (It can, of course, be neither). These two definitions allow us
      to define open and closed sets in <m>\RR^n</m>.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>\RR^n</m>. Then <m>A</m> is
          called <term>open</term> is all of its points are interior
          points. Equivalently, <m>A</m> does not contin any boundary
          points. Alternatively, <m>A</m> is called
          <term>closed</term> if it contains all of its boundary
          points (or, equivalently, if it contains its boundary).
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      This definition properly extends the notions of open and closed
      intervals in <m>\RR</m>. The boundary points of an interval are
      the endpoints. The open intervals lacks their endpoints and the
      closed intervals included their endpoints. In <m>\RR^n</m>, the
      boundaries are much more complicated than endpoints: they can be
      intricate geometric shapes.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The sphere <m>S^{n-1}</m> in <m>\RR^n</m> is all vectors of
          length one. The closed ball <m>B^{n}</m> in <m>\RR^n</m> is
          all vectors of length one or less. The sphere
          <m>S^{n-1}</m>is the boundary of the closed ball <m>B^n</m>,
          and the closed ball is closed because all points of the
          sphere are all contained in the closed ball.

      In addition to open and closed sets in <m>\RR^n</m>, the is a
      direct extension of intervals.

      Intervals are rectangular objects. In <m>\RR^2</m>, there are
      filled-in rectangles, including the hollow bounding rectangle if
      the interval is closed and excluding it if the interval is open.
      In <m>\RR^3</m>, intervals are solid rectangular prisms whose
      boundaries are rectangular boxes. In higher dimensions, we
      think of intervals are higher-dimensional rectangular prisms.
