  <title>Topology of <m>\RR^n</m></title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Topology is a branch of mathematics which studies concepts of shape,
      near-ness and distance.
      You might think that such a study woulds just be geometry,
      and you would be partially correct.
      Topology is like a coarser version of geometry.
      It cares about broad notions of near and far instead of precise distances,
      and about types of shapes instead of precisely defined specifics.
      Though it lacks the precision of other parts of geometry,
      it is fundamental to modern mathematics.

      We have already seen some topology of <m>\RR</m> in single variable calculus,
      mostly notably in the definition of open and closed intervals:
      <m>(a,b)</m> and <m>[a,b]</m>.
      Open intervals did not include their endpoints but closed intervals did.
      Openness and closedness are central to topolgoy.
      In this brief chapter, we will extend the notions of opennes,
      closedness and intervals to <m>\RR^n</m>.
      We will need these notions to understand multivariable functions in the next section.
