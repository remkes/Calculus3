    The previous section built the environment for linear algebra:
    <m>\RR^n</m>.
    We want to know what operations we can perform on <m>\RR^n</m>;
    there are several.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>sum</term> of two vectors <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> in <m>\RR^n</m> is the sum taken componentwise.
        <me>
          u + v = \begin{pmatrix}u_1\\u_2\\\vdots\\u_n\end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix}v_1\\v_2\\\vdots\\v_n\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}u_1 + v_1\\u_2 + v_2\\\vdots\\u_n + v_n\end{pmatrix}
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>

    Vector addition is visualized by putting the start of one vector at the end of the other vector,
    as in <xref ref="figure-vector-addition">Figure</xref>.
    Note that we can only add two vectors in the same dimension.
    We can't add a vector in <m>\RR^2</m> to a vector in <m>\RR^3</m>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>u</m> is a vector in <m>\RR^n</m> and <m>a \in \RR</m> is a real number,
        then the <term>scalar multiplication</term>
        of <m>u</m> and <m>a</m> is multiplication by <m>a</m> in each component of <m>u</m>.
        By convention,
        scalar multiplication is written with the scalar on the left of the vector.
        <me>
          au = a \begin{pmatrix}u_1\\u_2\\\vdots\\u_n\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}au_1\\au_2\\\vdots\\au_n\end{pmatrix}
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Multiplication stretches of shrink the vector while preserving the direction or flipping if if the scalar is negative.
    This is visualized in <xref ref="figure-scalar-multiplication">Figure</xref>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though there will be other <sq>multiplications</sq> to come,
    we generally say that we can't multiply vectors together in any way reminiscent of numbers.
    Instead, we can only multiply by scalars.
  </p>
  <p>
    Scalar multiplication also lets us define the difference between vectors.

    <caption>Vector Subtraction and Distance Between Vectors</caption>

  </figure>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The difference between two vectors <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> is the vector <m>u + (-1)v</m>,
        defined using addition and scalar multiplication.
        This works out to be componentwise subtraction.
        <me>
          u - v = u + (-1) v= \begin{pmatrix}u_1\\u_2\\\vdots\\u_n\end{pmatrix} + (-1) \begin{pmatrix}v_1\\v_2\\\vdots\\v_n\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}u_1 - v_1\\u_2 - v_2\\\vdots\\u_n - v_n\end{pmatrix}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Subtraction is visualized as finding a vector that completes a triangle,
        as in <xref ref="figure-vector-subtraction">Figure</xref>.
      </p>
    </statement>

    <statement>
      <p>
        Given a set of scalars
        (such as <m>\RR</m>),
        whenever we find a mathematical structure which has the two properties of addition and scalar multiplication,
        we call the structure <term>linear</term>.
        <m>\RR^n</m> is a linear space,
        because vectors allow for addition and scalar multiplication.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>length</term> of a vector <m>u</m> in <m>\RR^n</m> is written <m>|u|</m> and is given by a generalized form of the Pythagorean rule for right triangles.
        <me>
          |u| = \sqrt{u_1^2 + u_2^2 + \ldots + u_n^2}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        This length is also called the <term>norm</term> of the vector.
        A vector of length one is called a <term>unit vector</term>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    If we think of vectors as directions from the origin towards a point,
    this definition of length gives exactly what we expect:
    the physical length of that arrow in <m>\RR^2</m> and <m>\RR^3</m>.
    Past <m>\RR^3</m>, we don't have a natural notion of length.
    This definition serves as a reasonable generalization to <m>\RR^4</m> and higher dimensions which we can't visualize.
    Note also that <m>|u| = 0</m> only if <m>u</m> is the zero vector.
    All other vectors have positive length.
  </p>
  <p>
    Often the square root is annoying and we find it convenient to work with the square of length.
    <me>
      |u|^2 = u_1^2 + u_2^2 + \ldots + u_n^2
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    The notions of length and difference allow us to define the distance between two vectors.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>distance between two vectors</term>
        <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> in <m>\RR^n</m> is the length of their difference:
        <m>|u-v|</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    You can check from the definition that <m>|u-v| = |v-u|</m>,
    so distance doesn't depend on which comes first.
    If <m>|\cdot|</m> were absolute value in <m>\RR</m>,
    this definition would match the notion of distance between numbers on the number line.
