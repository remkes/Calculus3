        Describe these lines as offset spans. Everything is in
        <m>\RR^3</m>. 
        <ol>
          <li>
            The line through <m>(1,0,2)</m> with direction
            <m>(-1,-1,-2)</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The line perpendicular to the plane <m>x - y = 0</m> and
            through the point <m>(1,0,5)</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The line which is the intersection of th planes <m>-2x + y
            + z = 0</m> and <m>3x - 3y + z = 0</m>.
          </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Calculate equations for these planes. (12)
        <ol>
          <li>
            The plane parallel to <m>x + y + z = 0</m> but three units
            above (meaning that we move from the plane by increasing
            the <m>z</m> coordinate). 
          </li>
          <li>
            The plane with normal <m>(1,0,1)</m> through the point
            <m>(3,0,3)</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The plane through the points <m>(1,0,0</m>, <m>(0,1,0)</m>
            and <m>(0,0,1)</m>
          </li>
        </ol>

    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Calculate the intersection of these objects.
        <ol>
          <li>
            The plane <m>x + y - z = 0</m> and the plane <m>x + y +
            z=4</m>. (Describe the line as an offset span). 
          </li>
          <li>
            The line <m>(1,0,1) + \Span \{(-1,0,2)\}</m> and the plane
            <m>x + 4y = 0</m>.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
        The rotation matrix by angle <m>\theta</m> (counterclockwise
        from above) around the <m>x</m> axis in <m>\RR^3</m>
        is
        <me>
          \begin{pmatrix}
            1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
            0 \amp \cos \theta \amp -\sin \theta \\
            0 \amp \sin \theta \amp \cos \theta 
          \end{pmatrix}
        </me>.
        Likewise, for rotation around the <m>y</m> axis the matrix is 
        <me>
          \begin{pmatrix}
            \cos \theta \amp 0 \amp -\sin \theta \\
            0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
            \sin \theta \amp 0 \amp \cos \theta 
          \end{pmatrix}
        </me>
        and for rotation around the <m>z</m> axis the matrix is
        <me>
          \begin{pmatrix}
            \cos \theta \amp -\sin \theta \amp 0 \\
            \sin \theta \amp \cos \theta \amp 0  \\
            0 \amp 0 \amp 1 
          \end{pmatrix}
        </me>.
        <ol>
          <li>
            Check that the rotation by a quarter turn around the
            <m>z</m> axis does what is expected to the vectors
            <m>(1,1,1)</m>, <m>(4,4,0)</m> and <m>(0,0,5)</m>. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Show that the composition of a quarter turn around the
            <m>x</m> and a quarter turn around the <m>y</m> axis
            produces a rotation around the <m>z</m> axis.
          </li>
          <li>
            Show that in the previous calculation, reversing the order
            of the composition changes the direction of the <m>z</m>
            axis rotation.
          </li>
