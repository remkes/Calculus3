    <title>Definition of Parametric Cuves</title>
    <p>
      The major goal of this course is the extension of calculus to
      functions with multiple variable inputs and/or outputs. In
      <xref ref="vector-geometry">Chapter</xref>, we introduced linear
      transformations, which were function <m>\RR^n \rightarrow
      \RR^m</m>, but we would like to also investigate non-linear
      functions. Vector-valued function are the first step in that
      direction: they have a single-input but multi-variable non-linear
      output. The first and most important interpretation of
      vector-valued function is parametric curve. 
    </p>
    <p>
      A parametric curves describes interpret a vector-valued function
      as a position in some euclidean space depending on time; as
      such, parametric curves
      are used to talk about motion through space. The calculus of
      parametric curves is a way to understand the physics of such
      motion, covering both linear and angular velocity and
      acceleration in a nice, holistic approach. When considering
      parametric curves, we should imagine the movement of point-like
      objects through space under the influence of various forces.
      Projectiles with gravity and air friction is one imporant
      example; the motions of planets, moons and satellite under
      gravity is another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering the motion of stellar objects around a large gravity
      source (such as planets, asteroids and comets around the sun),
      we will use the caluculus of parametric curves to derive
      Kepler's laws of planetary motion from the basic assumptions of
      Newtonian mechanics. Kepler's laws predate Newton, but they
      were simply observed, not derived. The fact that Newton's
      physics, with multivariable calculus, can recover these
      observations from first principles of motion and gravity is a
      major accomplishment of that theory. In order to cover Kepler's
      laws in full, these notes also include descriptions of conics as
      parametric curves.

    <title>Parametric Curves</title>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A parametric curve in <m>\RR^n</m> is a continuous
          function <m>\gamma :[a,b] \rightarrow \RR^n</m>, that is,
          a continuous vector-valued function defined on an
          interval. As is convention, we will typically use the
          symbol <m>\gamma</m> for an arbitrary parametric curve.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      We identify a parametric curve with its image: that is, we
      think of a curve as a decription of the set of points in
      <m>\RR^n</m> which are the output of the curve. In this
      interpretation, we think of the curve as describing motion
      along this set: we start at the point <m>\gamma(a) \in
      \RR^n</m> and move along the curve, ending at <m>\gamma(b) \in
      \RR^n</m> when we get to the end of the domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The continuity condition is important, since a parametric
      curve is a connected path. We could think of vector-valued
      functions which jump around, but these don't really fit the
      notion of a curve. Continuity is also necessary for
      differentiability and we will assume (in order to avoid
      restating it multiple times) that all our parametric curves
      are differentiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      For visualizing parametric curves, we graph only the output or
      image of the curve. There is never a <m>t</m> axis in any of
      these graphs; instead, the variable <m>t</m> is the parameter
      of movement along the curve.

      Notice that we defined this curve on the domain <m>[0,
      2\pi]</m>. If we extend this domain, the curve just starts to
      retrace over the circle. It's good to observe that parametric
      curves can self-intersect and trace over themselves many
      times.

    <title>Parametric Curves in Polar Coordinates</title>
    <p>
      Once we are comfortable with changing coordinate systems, we
      can use any coordinate system we wish to describe parametric
      curves. For example, polar coordinates in <m>\RR^2</m> are
      well suited to describing any kind of object that is circular
      in some sense. Curves in polar coordinates are given as
      <m>\gamma(t) = (r(t), \theta(t))</m> instead of <m>\gamma(t) =
      (x(t),y(t))</m>. The circle in parametric coordinates is
      <m>\gamma(t) = (1, t)</m>; if we write the components
      individually, we could write <m>\theta(t) = t</m> and <m>r(t)
      = 1</m>. The logarithmic spiral has components <m>\theta(t) =
      t</m> and <m>r(t) = 2e^{\frac{t}{4}}</m>. The archimedian
      spiral has components <m>\theta(t) = t</m> and <m>r(t) =
      t</m>.
