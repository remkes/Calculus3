      Kepler's laws were originally formulated from the observations
      of planets in the night sky and were written down before Newton.
      One of the triumphs of Newtonian mechanics is the recovery of
      Kepler's laws. In this section, I start with Newton's gravity
      and derive Kepler's laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kepler described three laws of planetary motion.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Satellites in orbit around a large gravity source have
            elliptical orbits with the large object at one of the foci
            of the ellipse.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The radius of a satellite sweeps out equal area over time.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The period <m>T</m> of a satellite and the major axis
            <m>a</m> of the associated ellipse satisfy <m>T^2 = \alpha
            a^3</m> for some constant <m>\alpha</m> depending only
            upon the mass of the large object.

    <title>Kepler's First Law</title>
    <p>
      The setup for approaching Kepler's laws is shown in <xref
      ref="figure-keplers-laws" />. 
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            There is a large stationary object of mass <m>M</m>, and a
            small object of mass <m>m</m> in orbit around the larger
            object. I must assume that <m>m \ll M</m> to allow the
            larger object to be essentially stationary.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I place the stationary object of mass <m>M</m> at the
            origin in <m>\RR^3</m>. We might work in the plane since
            the orbits are planar, but it is more useful to think of
            the orbit sitting in the <m>xy</m> plane in <m>\RR^3</m>.
            This will be important, since it turns out to be useful to
            consider the perperdicular direction to the plane of orbit
            and use normals and binormals in <m>\RR^3</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The curve <m>\gamma(t) = (r(t),\theta(t),z(t))</m>
            decribes the motion of the orbiting object over time, in
            cylindrical coordinates (which reduce to polar coordinates
            in the <m>xy</m> plane). In the third coordinate
            <m>z(t)</m>, I expect that <m>z(t) = 0</m> at all times
            <m>t</m> (which will produce a curve in the <m>xy</m>
            plane in polar coordinates), but I don't assume this.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The curve <m>\gamma(t)</m> is unknown and I wish to
            derive it from Newtonian physics. I will prove Kelper's
            laws using the derived curve.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The force of gravity has magnitude
            <me>
              F = \frac{GmM}{|\gamma(t)|^2} 
            </me>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The direction of the force is <m>-\gamma(t)</m>, since the
            force wishes to pull the object back towards the origin.
            Since I needl just direction without changing magnitude,
            I use the unit vector <m>u(t) = \gamma(t) /
            |\gamma(t)|</m> for the direction of <m>\gamma(t)</m>.

        <li>
          <p>
            Newton's first law <m>F = ma</m> applies, so the
            acceleration is
            <me>
              a(t) = \frac{-GM}{|\gamma(t)|^2} u(t) =
              \frac{-GM}{|\gamma(t)|^3} \gamma(t)

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Acceleration is the second derivative of position,
            therefore Newton's first law becomes
            <me>
              \frac{d^2}{dt^2} \gamma(t) = \frac{-GM}{|\gamma(t)|^3}
              \gamma(t)
            </me>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I write <m>h(t) = \gamma(t) \times \gamma^\prime(t)</m>.
            <m>h(t)</m> is in the binormal direction, but is not
            necessarily a unit vector. This seems like a strange
            definition, but the vector <m>h</m> turns out to be very
            useful in the proof.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Newton's law is a multivariable differential equation; solving
      it directly is very difficult and well beyond the scope of this
      course. Our approach is indirect. We start with two seeminly
      random calculations, which I will label as lemmas for convenient
      reference. For convenience of notation, I often drop
      the <m>t</m> variable, writing <m>\gamma</m> instead of
      <m>\gamma(t)</m> and likewise for other functions of <m>t</m>.

        The first term <m>\gamma^\prime \times \gamma^\prime = 0</m>
        since any vector with itself in the cross product is <m>0</m>.
        Then <m>\gamma</m> and the acceleration <m>a</m> are in the
        same direction (up to <m>\pm1</m>), since the force pulls back
        towards the origin. Vectors in the same direction likewise
        have <m>0</m> cross product. Therefore, it is true that
        <m>\frac{d}{dt} h = 0</m>.

      In addition to these two calculation lemma, I'm going to list

          This is exactly the same as Equation <xref

        Since <m>u</m> is always a unit vector, I can apply Lemma 
        <xref ref="lemma-unit-vector-derivative" />, which says
        that <m>u \times u^\prime = 0</m>. Also since <m>u</m> is a
        unit vector, <m>u \cdot u = |u|^2 = 1</m>. This deals with
        both of the dot products.
        <men xml:id="equation-reference4">

        Then I consider the following derivative.

      </p>
      <p>
        The first term here is <m>a \times h</m>. The second term
        involves the derivative of <m>h</m>. But Lemma <xref
        ref="lemma-reference1" /> said that the derivative
        of <m>h</m> is zero, so this term vanishes.
        <me>
          \frac{d}{dt} (\gamma^\prime \times h) = a \times h
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I'll replace <m>a \times h</m> with the expression from
        Equation <xref ref="equation-reference4" />
        <me>
          \frac{d}{dt} (\gamma^\prime \times h) = GM u^\prime
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I've made progress with our difficult differential
        equation: I have a time derivative on both sides. I can
        simply integrate both sides. 
        <me>
          \gamma^\prime \times h = GM u + c
        </me>
        In this integration, <m>c</m> is a <em>vector</em> of
        constants of integration. (That vector corresponds to intial
        conditions of velocity and some orbital distance; the rest of
        the initial position is essentially
        determined by the choice of coordinates.) I take the dot
        product with <m>\gamma</m>.
        <me>
          \gamma \cdot (\gamma^\prime \times h) = GM (\gamma \cdot u)
          + \gamma \cdot c = GM |\gamma| u \cdot u + |\gamma| |c| \cos
          \theta = GM + |\gamma| |c| \cos \theta
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here <m>\theta</m> is the angle between <m>\gamma</m> and
        <m>c</m>. Since I haven't specified a starting point, I can
        choose coordinates such that <m>c</m> is in the positive
        <m>x</m> direction, which means that this <m>\theta</m> is the
        usual <m>\theta</m> of polar coordinates and <m>|\gamma|</m>
        is the usual <m>r</m> of polar coodinates.

        Then I put this new <m>e</m> into the equation.

        ref="lemma-reference4" />. But
        <m>(\gamma \times \gamma^\prime)</m> is the definition of

      </p>
      <p>
        <m>|h|^2</m> is a constant, since <m>h</m> doesn't change

        make another definition.

        I can then replace the numerator of Equation <xref

      <p>
        Replace <m>\frac{|c|}{GM}</m> by <m>e</m>, since that's how I
        defined <m>e</m> in Equation <xref

    <p>
      In the previous work, the eccentricity was defined as <m>e =
      |c|/GM</m>. Notice that the eccentricity depends on the
      constants of integration. That makes sense since those constants
      determine inital velocity and some orbital radius. If <m>e\lt
      1</m>, then the initial conditions indicate an ellipse. If <m>e
      \geq1</m> then the result is a hyperbola.  The difference is
      precisely the notion of escape velocity <mdash/> these initial
      conditions tell us if the satellite has enough initial energy to
      escape or be trapped in orbit. If trapped in orbit, the orbits
      are elliptical. If escaping, the path is parabolic or
      hyperbolic. For the rest of this section, I will assume that the
      orbits are elliptical, i.e., that the original velocity is less
      than escape velocity, to prove the final two laws. (The final
      two laws specifically refer to periodic orbits, so the
      assumption is both reasonable and necessary.)

    <proof>
      <p>
        I will write <m>A(t)</m> for the area swept out in this way.
        My goal is to prove that <m>A^\prime(t)</m> is constant. I will
        approach this by looking at the infinitesimal area <m>dA</m>
        swept out over an infinitesimal time interval <m>dt</m>. Such
        an area is a small triangle, shown in gray in <xref
        ref="figure-sweeping-area" />. It has side length
        <m>r</m> and base <m>db</m>, which I can assume is
        perpendicular to the radius. Therefore, the area <m>dA</m> of
        the infinitesimal triangle is <m>\frac{1}{2} r db</m>. Then
        <m>db</m>, as an infinitesimal arclength, is <m>rd\theta</m>,
        so <m>dA = \frac{1}{2} r^2 d\theta</m>, which I can integrate
        (with a temporary internal variable for the integration).
        <me>
          A(t) = \int_0^t \frac{1}{2} r(w)^2 d\theta = \int_0^t
          \frac{1}{2} r(w)^2 \frac{d\theta}{dw} dw

      </p>
      <p>
        I calculate the derivative <m>\frac{dA}{dt}</m>.
        <me>
          \frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \int_0^t \frac{1}{2} r(w)^2
          \frac{d\theta}{dw} dw = \frac{1}{2} r(t)^2
          \frac{d\theta}{dt}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I return to some of the derivations of the previous
        section to understand this equation. 
        In Cartesian coordinates, <m>\gamma</m> has
        this form.
        <me>
          \gamma(t) = (r(t) \cos \theta(t), r(t) \sin \theta(t), 0)
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        The the unit vector <m>u = \gamma(t) / |\gamma(t)|</m> is
        <m>u(t) = (\cos \theta (t), \sin \theta(t),0)</m>. I
        calculate its derivative.
        <men xml:id="equation-reference6">
          \frac{du}{dt} = (-\sin \theta(t), \cos \theta(t), 0)
          \frac{d\theta}{dt}

      </p>
      <p>
        I calculate <m>u \times u^\prime</m>.
        <men xml:id="equation-reference5">
          u \times \frac{du}{dt} = (0,0,1) \frac{d\theta}{dt}
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        Recall Lemma <xref ref="lemma-reference2" />. 
        <me>
          h = |\gamma(t)|^2 u \times u^\prime
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        I replace the cross product on the right with the same
        expression from Equation <xref
        ref="equation-reference5" />.
        <me>
          h = |\gamma(t)|^2 \frac{d\theta}{dt} (0,0,1)
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        I take the magnitude of this vector. (I choose a direction
        of orbit for that <m>\frac{d\theta}{dt}</m> is positive.)
        <me>
          |h| = |\gamma(t)|^2 \frac{d\theta}{dt} 
        </me>
        Recall <m>r(t) = |\gamma(t)|</m>. 
        <me>
          |h| = r(t)^2 \frac{d\theta}{dt}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now this looks familiar: if has the same right side as
        Equation <xref ref="equation-reference6" />. Therefore, it is
        equation to the left side of that equation.
        <m>\frac{dA}{dt}</m>.
        <men xml:id="equation-reference13">
          \frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} |h|
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        But I know that <m>h</m> is constant by Lemma <xref
        ref="lemma-reference1" />. Therefore, the rate of
        change of the area <m>A</m> must be constant.

          (Kepler's Third Law) The period <m>T</m> of the revolution
          and the semi-major axis <m>a</m> of the ellipse satisfy
          <m>T^2 = \alpha a^3</m> for some constant <m>\alpha</m>
          which only depends on the mass of the central object.

      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        I start with the Equation <xref ref="equation-reference13" />
        in the previous proof.
        <me>
          A(t) = \frac{|h|}{2} t

      </p>
      <p>
        The period <m>T</m> is the time needed to complete one whole
        orbit. The area swept out over time <m>T</m> should be the
        whole ellipse. Recall an ellipse with semiaxes <m>a</m> and
        <m>b</m> has area <m>\pi a b</m>. I make the two areas
        equal.
        <men xml:id="equation-reference11">
          A(T) = \frac{|h|T}{2} = \pi a b \implies T = \frac{2\pi

        From Equation <xref ref="equation-reference7-1" /> and
        Equation <xref ref="equation-reference7-2" />, I have
        expressions for the semimajor and semiminor axes (<m>a</m> and
        <m>b</m>) in terms of the eccentricity <m>e</m> and the
        distance <m>d</m> from the focus to the directrix.

      </p>
      <p>
        I take the square root of <m>a^2</m> and then the ratio of
        the two equations.
        <men xml:id="equation-reference12">
          \frac{a}{b^2} =

        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we can relate <m>ed</m> to <m>G</m>, <m>M</m> and
        <m>h</m>. Recall the definition of <m>e</m> from Equation 
        <xref ref="equation-reference8" /> and <m>d</m> from Equation

        <men>
          ed = \frac{|h|^2}{GM} \implies |h|^2 = edGM
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
       eI use this to substitute for <m>|h|^2</m> in Equation <xref
        ref="equation-reference11" />.
        <me>
          T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 a^2 b^2}{GMed}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then use Equation <xref ref="equation-reference12" /> to
        substitute for <m>ed</m> and simplify.
        <me>
          T^2= \frac{4\pi^2 a^2 b^2}{\frac{GMb^2}{a}} =
          \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} a^3
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the desired result. The proportionality constant is
        <m>\frac{4\pi^2}{GM}</m> involves <m>M</m>, the mass of the
        central objects, and other constants.
