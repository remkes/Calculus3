          The <term>parabola</term> is all points which are

          The focus and directrix entirely determine the parabola.

      The parabola is defined as all points equidistant from a focus
      and a directrix. All other conics have foci, but the parabola
      is the only with a directrix. However, there is another method
      of describing all conics in terms of focus and directrix. To
      get to that description, consider first the parabola in more
      detail in the following diagram. In <xref
      ref="figure-focus-directrix">Figure</xref>, we've labeled the
      conic itself as <m>\gamma</m>, the focus <m>F</m> and the
      directrix <m>L</m> and the distance between the focus and the
      directrix, labeled <m>d</m>.

      We've also labeled an angle <m>\theta</m> and two distances
      <m>r</m> and <m>l</m> in this diagram. The point <m>P</m> is,
      by definition, on the parabola because the distances from
      <m>P</m> to the focus and to the directrix are equal. In <xref
      ref="figure-focus-directrix" />, <m>r=l</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can generalize the construction by allowing <m>r</m> and
      <m>l</m> to be non-equal, but insisting that their ration is
      constant. That is, given a focus <m>F</m> and a directrix
      <m>L</m>, we consider all points <m>P</m>, such
      <m>\frac{r}{l}</m> is a constant. <m>\frac{r}{l} = 1</m> will
      recover the parabola, but other choices of the constant will
      result, amazingly, in other conics.

          The <term>eccentricity</term> of a conic defined via a focus

      We would like to get a description of conics as a parametric
      curves using the focus, directrix and eccentricity. We will use
      polar coordinates for this, assuming that <m>F</m> is at the
      origin. In <xref ref="figure-focus-directrix">Figure</xref>,
      putting <m>F</m> at the origin means that <m>r</m> and
      <m>\theta</m>, as labelled, are exactly polar coordinates.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\gamma</m> be a conic described by a focus at the
          origin, a directrix <m>x=d</m> and an eccentricity <m>e</m>.
          Then <m>\gamma</m> is described by a polar locus,
          <me>
            r = \frac{ed}{1 + e \cos \theta}
          </me>,
          or by a polar parametric curve using <m>\theta</m> as the
          parameter,
          <me>
            \gamma(\theta) = (r(\theta), \theta) = \left(\frac{ed}{1 +
            e \cos \theta}, \theta\right)
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        From the diagram and some trigonometry, we can see that <m>l =
        d - r\cos \theta</m>. Eccentricity is the ratio of <m>r</m>
        to <m>l</m>, so eccentricity has this form:
        <me>
          e = \frac{r}{d-r\cos\theta}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        If we solve for <m>r</m> in this equaiton we get the desired
        polar locus.

          r = \frac{ed}{1 + e \cos \theta}
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then we simply choose <m>\theta</m> as the parameter for the
        polar parametric description.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <proposition xml:id="prop-conic-eccentricity">
      <statement>
        <p>
          All four conics can be defined in terms of a focus <m>F</m>,
          directrix <m>L</m>, and eccentricity <m>e</m>. A conic is
          thus redefined to be all points where the ratio of the
          distance to the focus over the distance to the directrix is
          constant and equal to the eccentricity. The hyperbola has
          eccentricity <m>e>1</m>, the parabola has eccentricity
          <m>e=1</m>, the ellipse has eccentricity <m>e\lt 1</m>. The
          circle is the special limit case <m>e=0</m>, though to
          realize the shape we have to allow the distance between
          <m>F</m> and <m>L</m> to approach infinity.

        We will prove all cases except the limit case of the circle.

        this section.

        This is the equation for a leftward-opening parabola, so
        <m>e=1</m> does recover the parabola.
      </p>
      <p>
        For all cases except the circle, we recovered the standard
        equation of the conic. We found a hyperbola when <m>e>1</m>,
        an ellipse when <m>e\lt 1</m>, and a parabola when <m>e=1</m>.
        As mentioned in the proposition, the circle is a strange limit
        case as <m>e \rightarrow 0</m>, but <m>e \rightarrow 0</m>
        also increases the distance <m>d \rightarrow \infty</m>.
