    <title>A Motivating Example</title>
    <p>
      Let's reconsider the box-in-a-sphere problem of <xref
      ref="example-box-sphere">Example</xref>. Instead of working
      inside the sphere, we could just consider a prism centred at the
      origin with positive octant vertex <m>(a,b,c)</m> and volume
      <m>8abc</m>. That maximized by itself will diverge to
      <m>\infty</m>, since we have nothing to bound the prism.
      However, we can consider the <em>constraint</em> <m>x^2 + y^2 +
      z^2 = r^2</m> for some fixed <m>r</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea, in general, is to ask when a function <m>f(x_1, x_2,
      \ldots, x_n)</m> is optimized subject to one (or more)
      constraints <m>g(x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n) = c</m>. Let's first
      think of this geometrically. If both <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> were
      functions of two variables, we could draw contour plots.
      <m>g(x,y) = c</m> would be a fixed countour line for <m>g</m>,
      and we would be asking for maximum of <m>f</m> along that
      contour line. We can notice that such a maximum occurs where a
      countour line for <m>f</m> touches the contour line <m>g(x,y) =
      c</m> and then backs off. That is, the maximum occurs where the
      contour lines are tangent.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the contour lines are level sets, which are defined by their
      normals. The normals are given by gradients. If the level sets
      are tangent to each other, that means the gradients must be in
      the same direction (up to a sign). That is, this optimization
      occurs when <m>\nabla f \parallel \nabla g</m>. We can express
      this as <m>\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g</m> for some real
      constant <m>\lambda \neq 0</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This holds in any dinemsion: the level sets will be tangent and
      there will be a constant <m>\lambda</m> with <m>\nabla f =
      \lambda \nabla g</m>. To optimize with constraint, we now have
      a system of equation in <m>n+1</m> variables, the <m>x_i</m> and
      <m>\lambda</m>: <m>\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g</m> and <m>g(x_1,
      x_2, \ldots, v_n) = c</m>. To optimize the situation, we try to
      solve this system. This method is called the method of Lagrange
      Multipliers.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Historically, the connection to the mathematician Lagrange
      comes from a <em>Lagrangian</em> of the form <m>f + \lambda
      g</m>. We're essentially looking for critical points of this
      Lagrangian).

          What is the largest rectangle with fixed perimeter <m>p</m>?
          The rectangle has length <m>l</m> and height <m>h</m>, with
          area <m>A(h,l) = hl</m>. The constraint is the fixed
          perimeter <m>2h + 2l = p</m>, so the function is <m>g(h,l) =
          2h + 2l</m>. The gradients are <m>\nabla A = (l,h)</m> and
          <m>\nabla g = (2,2)</m>. The equation <m>\nabla A = \lambda
          \nabla g</m> is two equations: <m>h = 2\lambda</m> and <m>l
          = 2 \lambda</m>. We can substitute these into the constrait
          <m>2h + 2l = p</m> to get <m>8 \lambda = p</m> so <m>\lambda
          = p/8</m> and <m>h = l = 2 \lambda = p/4</m>. The area is

          Instead of a sphere, we could ask for the largest box inside

          \frac{y^2}{b^2} + \frac{z^2}{c^2} = 1</m>. Geometrically,
          this because more difficult. However, using Lagrange
          Multipliers, we only need to change the constraint from the
          equation of the sphere to the equation of the ellipse.

          As we've seen in these examples, constrained optimization is
          a particularly useful tool for sovling complicated geometry
          problems. Here is another such problem. Say we have the
          equation of a very general ellipse centred at the origin,
          such as <m>17x^2 + 12xy + 8y^2 = 100</m>. Since this
          ellipse has an <m>xy</m> term, it is not oriented along any
          axis <mdash/> it's on some slanted plane through the origin.
          So we don't know, from inspection, what is major and minor
          semi-axes are. However, we can ask for the points further
          from and closest too the origin. That's asking for the min
          and max of the funciton <m>f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2</m> on the

          This gives us the four points <m>(2,1)</m>, <m>(-2,-1)</m>,
          <m>(2,-4)</m> and <m>(-2,4)</m>. The semi-major axis is the
          distance to the further point, and the semi-minor axis is
          the distance to the closet point (from the origin).
          Therefore, the semi-major axis is <m>\sqrt{20}</m> units
          long along the line in the direction <m>(2,-4)</m> and the
          semi-minor axis is <m>\sqrt{5}</m> units long in the
          direction <m>(2,1)</m>.
