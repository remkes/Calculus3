  <title>Convergence Tests</title>
  <p>
    When we are using a series, the most pressing problem is convergence.
    We want to work with actual values,
    but we are only guaranteed those values when the series converge.
    Therefore, mathematicians have devised many ways to test a series for convergence.
    We already have the test for divergence.
    In this section,
    we will present several more ways to test a series for convergence.
