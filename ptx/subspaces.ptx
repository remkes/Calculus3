  <title>Linear and Affine Subspaces</title>
  <p>
    In addition to vectors,
    we want to consider various geometric objects that live in <m>\RR^n</m>.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>linear subspace</term> of <m>\RR^n</m> is a non-empty set of vectors <m>L</m> with two properties.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>u,v \in L</m> then <m>u+v \in L</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>u \in L</m> and <m>a \in \RR</m> then <m>av \in L</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    These are the two basic operations on <m>\RR^n</m>:
    we can add vectors and we can multiply by scalars.
    Linear subspaces are just subsets where we can still perform both operations and remain in the subset.
  </p>
  <p>
    Geometrically,
    vector addition and scalar multiplication produce flat objects:
    lines, planes, and their higher-dimensions analogues.
    Also, since we can take <m>a=0</m>,
    we must have <m>0 \in L</m>.
    So linear subspaces can be informally defined as flat subsets which include the origin.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        An <term>affine subspace</term> of <m>\RR^n</m> is a non-empty set of vectors <m>A</m> which can be described as a sum <m>v+u</m> where <m>v</m> is a fixed vector and <m>u</m> is any vector in some fixed linear subspace <m>L</m>.
        With some abuse of notation, we can write this as
        <me>
          A = u + L
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We think of affine subspaces as flat spaces that may be offset from the origin.
        The vector <m>u</m> is called the
        <term>offset vector</term>.
        Affine spaces include linear spaces,
        since we can also take <m>u</m> to be the zero vector and have <m>A=L</m>.
        Affine objects are the lines,
        planes and higher dimensional flat objects that may or may not pass through the origin.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Notice that we defined both affine and linear subspaces to be non-empty.
    The empty set <m>\emptyset</m> is <em>not</em>
    a linear or affine subspace.
  </p>
  <p>
    We need ways to algebraically describe linear and affine substapces.
    There are two main approaches:
    loci and spans, but these notes will only focus on loci.
