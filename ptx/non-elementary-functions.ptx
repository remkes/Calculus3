  <title>Non-Elementary Functions</title>
  <p>
    In addition to finding connections between known functions, Taylor series can help us construct entirely new functions.
    These are often called non-elementary functions
    (the elementary functions are those which we already have worked with:
    polynomials, roots, exponentials,
    logarithms, trig, and hyperbolics).

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The Bessel functions of order
        <m>k \in \NN</m> are given by this series.
        <me>
          J_k(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n}}{2^{2n+k} ((n+k)!)^2}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Bessel functions are like the trigonometric functions,
        but the terms in the denominators are larger.
        They oscilate like trig functions,
        but with decaying amplitude.
        They are important for spherical and circular waves,
        such as sound waves or ripples on a pond.

        The Bessel-Clifford functions are givesn by this series.
        <me>
          C_k(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\pi (k+n) x^n}{n!}

        The Polylogarithm functions are given by this series. (Note that for <m>s=1</m> the polylogarithm is <m>Li_1(x) = -\ln (1-x)</m>,
        the conventional logarithm).
        <me>
          Li_s(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^{n}}{n^s}
        </me>

    These three examples are just the very start of a huge world of non-elementary functions.
