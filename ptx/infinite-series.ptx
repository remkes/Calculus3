  <title>Infinite Series</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The first two chapters of these notes,
      covering Infinite Series and Taylor Series,
      cover the same as the final two chapters of the Calculus II notes.
      Much of what we cover is review and most of the these notes are identical to the Calculus II notes,
      but we will find a new focus on Taylor series and new material on approximation and error analysis.

    <p>
      There are three classical branches of calculus.
      The first two, derivatives and integrals,
      command the vast majority of the time and energy in most first year calculus classes.
      In many universities, these two topics are the entire course.
      However, there is a third branch of the calculus which deserves equal attention:
      infinite series.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some ways,
      the problem of infinite series is older than the problems motivating derivatives and integrals.
      Issues of infinite series go back to at least early Greek mathematics,
      where thinkers struggled with the puzzle known as Zeno's Paradox.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many forms of Zeno's Paradox; I will present one relatively common version.
      If you wish to travel from point <m>a</m> to point <m>b</m>,
      then first you must travel half-way.
      Having gone halfway to <m>b</m>,
      you must again cover half the remaining distance.
      Having gone <m>3/4</m> of the way to <m>b</m>,
      there is still a distance remaining,
      and you still must first cover half that distance.
      Repeating this process gives an infinite series of halves,
      all of which must be traversed to travel from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m>.
      Since doing an infinite number of things is not humanly possible,
      you will never be able to reach <m>b</m>.
      Finally, since this holds for any two points <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
      movement is impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obviously, Zeno's paradox doesn't hold,
      since we are able to move from one place to another.
      But Zeno's paradox has commanded the attention and imagination of philosophers and mathematicians for over 2000 years,
      as they struggled to deal with the infinity implicit in even the smallest movement.
      Infinite series is one way (though,
      some would argue, an incomplete way) of dealing with Zeno's paradox.
