          A parametric curve in <m>\RR^n</m> is a continuous function <m>\gamma :[a,b] \rightarrow \RR^n</m>, that is,
          a continuous vector-valued function defined on an interval.
          As is convention,
          we will typically use the symbol <m>\gamma</m> for an arbitrary parametric curve.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      We identify a parametric curve with its image:
      that is, we think of a curve as a decription of the set of points in <m>\RR^n</m> which are the output of the curve.
      In this interpretation,
      we think of the curve as describing motion along this set:
      we start at the point <m>\gamma(a) \in \RR^n</m> and move along the curve,
      ending at <m>\gamma(b) \in \RR^n</m> when we get to the end of the domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The continuity condition is important,
      since a parametric curve is a connected path.
      We could think of vector-valued functions which jump around,
      but these don't really fit the notion of a curve.
      Continuity is also necessary for differentiability and we will assume
      (in order to avoid restating it multiple times)
      that all our parametric curves are differentiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      For visualizing parametric curves,
      we graph only the output or image of the curve.
      There is never a <m>t</m> axis in any of these graphs;
      instead, the variable <m>t</m> is the parameter of movement along the curve.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The curve <m>\gamma(t) = (\cos t, \sin t)</m>,
          for <m>t \in [0, 2\pi]</m> traces out a circle,
          as in <xref ref="figure-parametric-curve1">Figure</xref>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Notice that we defined this curve on the domain <m>[0, 2\pi]</m>.
      If we extend this domain, the curve just starts to retrace over the circle.
      It's good to observe that parametric curves can self-intersect and trace over themselves many times.

        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Notice that this parametric curve is the graph of a function,
      specifically the function <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m> between <m>x = \frac{1}{5}</m> and <m>x=5</m>.
      Parametric curves where one of the components is just <m>t</m> can be interpreted as graphs of functions.

          A spiral in <m>\RR^2</m> is a parametric curve of the form
          <m>\gamma(t) = (f(t) \cos t, f(t) \sin t)</m> where <m>f(t)</m> is a monotonic function.
          It resembles the circle,
          but the radius is either increasing or decreasing as the curve traces around the circle.
          The curve <m>\gamma(t) = (2e^{\frac{t}{4}} \cos t, 2e^{\frac{t}{4}} \sin t)</m> is a logarithmic spiral,

    <title>Parametric Curves in Polar Coordinates</title>
    <p>
      Once we are comfortable with changing coordinate systems,
      we can use any coordinate system we wish to describe parametric curves.
      For example,
      polar coordinates in <m>\RR^2</m> are well suited to describing any kind of object that is circular in some sense.
      Curves in polar coordinates are given as
      <m>\gamma(t) = (r(t), \theta(t))</m> instead of <m>\gamma(t) = (x(t),y(t))</m>.
      The circle in parametric coordinates is <m>\gamma(t) = (1, t)</m>;
      if we write the components individually,
      we could write <m>\theta(t) = t</m> and <m>r(t) = 1</m>.
      The logarithmic spiral has components
      <m>\theta(t) = t</m> and <m>r(t) = 2e^{\frac{t}{4}}</m>.
      The archimedian spiral has components <m>\theta(t) = t</m> and <m>r(t) = t</m>.
