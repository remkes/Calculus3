  <title>Geometry and Graphs of Functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The graph of a single variable
      <m>f: \RR \rightarrow \RR</m> was a curve in <m>\RR^2</m> where one axis was input and one axis was output.
      The idea generalizes, so a graph has to show both the inputs and output.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A \subset \RR^n</m> be the domain of a scalar function <m>f: A \rightarrow \RR</m>.
          The <term>graph</term> of the scalar function is the subset of
          <m>\RR^{n+1}</m> consisting of all point
          <m>(x_1, x_2, \ldots,
          x_n, f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n))</m> for <m>(x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n) \in A</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Since we have to show input and outputs,
      the graph need many dimensions.
      If <m>n \geq 3</m>,
      then the graph is in <m>\RR^4</m> or a higher dimensional space.
      We can only actually see graphs of scalar function on <m>\RR^2</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <m>\RR^2</m> case is useful to understand the general situation.
      In this case,
      <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are in input (domain) and <m>z</m> is the output
      (range).
      We can think of the graph as a height function:
      over some point <m>(x,y)</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>,
      the graph sits at some height <m>z = f(x,y)</m>.
    </p>

      We used graphs extensively in single-variable calculus to understand derivatives and integrals:
      derivative were slopes of tangent lines and integrals were area under curves.
      We want to generalize this to the new higher-dimensional graphs.
      For functions <m>f:\RR^2 \rightarrow \RR</m>,
      it's not too difficult to extend the notions.
      Instead of tangent line, we now have
      <em>tangent planes</em>.
      Instead of area under the curve,
      we have volume under the surface.
      For <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m>,
      we have tangent n-spaces and (n+1)-hyper-volume under the n-dimensions graph surface.

    <title>Contour Plots</title>
    <p>
      As an alternative to conventional graphs of function,
      a nice way to visualize height functions is as topological maps.
      We refer to these visualizations as contour plots.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f: A \rightarrow \RR</m> be a scalar function for a domain <m>A \subset \RR^2</m>.
          A <term>countour plot</term> for <m>f</m> is a plot of curves in <m>\RR^2</m> where each curve is a locus of the form
          <m>f(x,y) = c</m> for some constant <m>c</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      A contour plot has a series of implicit curves at constant elevation;
      the constants <m>c</m> are the elevation.
      It shows curves where the function takes a specific value.
      By looking at the relationships of the curves,
      we can intuit how the function behaves.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider <m>f(x,y) = \frac{5}{x^2+y^2+1}</m>.
          It's graph is <xref ref="figure-3d-graph1">Figure</xref>.
          This function has a simple hill at the origin and slopes down in all direction.
          The contours are loci of the form <m>\frac{5}{x^2 + y^2 + 1} = c</m>,
          which can be rearranged as <m>\frac{5}{c} - 1 = x^2 + y^2</m>.
          These contours are all circles,
          and are shown in <xref ref="figure-contour-plot1">Figure</xref>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <figure xml:id="figure-contour-plot1">
      <caption>The circular contours of <m>f(x,y) = \frac{5}{x^2 + y^2
      + 1}</m></caption>
      <image width="700%" source="images/figure32.png" />
    </figure>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Contour diagrams can show many behaviours.
          <xref ref="figure-contour-plot2">Figure</xref>
          shows a pass or saddle point. (The saddle point will be formally defined in <xref ref="def-saddle-point">Definition</xref>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <figure xml:id="figure-contour-plot2">
      <caption>The contours of a saddle point</caption>
      <image width="1200%" source="images/figure34.png" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      These contour plots lead us to a general definition.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m> be a scalar function.
          A <term>level set</term> for <m>f</m> is a subset of <m>\RR^n</m> given by the equation
          <m>f(x_1, x_2, \ldots,
          x_n) = c</m> for some <m>c \in \RR</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Then a countour plot is just a drawing of a variety of level sets of a function <m>\RR^2 \rightarrow \RR</m>.
      It is useful to see where a function is constant.
      The resulting shapes tell us a great deal about the behaviour of the function.
      Level sets for <m>f: \RR^3 \rightarrow \RR</m> are called level surfaces.
