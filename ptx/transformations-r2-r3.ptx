  <title>Transformations of <m>\RR^2</m> or <m>\RR^3</m></title>
  <p>
    It is useful for us to specialize to transformations <m>\RR^2 \rightarrow \RR^2</m>,
    in order to build experience and intuition.
    As we noted above, linear transformations preserve flat objects.
    What can we do to <m>\RR^2</m> that preserves lines and preserves the origin?
  </p>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        There are five basic types of linear transformation of <m>\RR^2</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Rotations</em> about the origin
        (either clockwise or counter-clockwise)
        preserve lines.
        We can't rotate around any other point,
        since that would move the origin.
        Since we can choose any angle,
        there are infinitely many such rotations.
        Also, since rotating by <m>\theta</m> radians clockwise is the same as
        <m>2\pi - \theta</m> radians counter-clockwise,
        we typically choose to only deal with counter-clockwise rotations.
        Counter-clockwise rotations are considered positive and clockwise rotations are considered negative.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Reflections</em> over lines through the origin preserve lines.
        The line of reflection must be a line through the origin or else the reflection will move the origin.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Skews</em> are a little tricker to visualize.
        A skew is a transformation that takes either veritcal or horizontal lines
        (but not both)
        and tilts them diagonally.
        It changes squares into parallelograms.
        The tilted lines are still lines,
        so it is a linear transformation.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Dialations</em> are transformation which stretch or shink in various directions.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Projections</em> are transformations which collapse <m>\RR^2</m> down to a line through the origin.
        Two important exampels are projection onto either axis.
        Projection onto the <m>x</m> axis sends a point <m>(a,b)</m> to <m>(a,0)</m>,
        removing the <m>y</m> component.
        Likewise, projection onto the <m>y</m> axis sends a point <m>(a,b)</m> to <m>(0,b)</m>,
        removing the <m>x</m> component.
        In a similar manner,
        we can project onto any line though the origin by sending each point to the closest point on the line.
        Finally, there is the projection to the origin which sends all points to the origin.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    All linear transformation of <m>\RR^2</m> are generated by composition of transformations of these five types.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can also specialize to transformations of <m>\RR^3</m>,
    though it is not as easy to give a complete account of the basic types.
    However, all of the types listed for <m>\RR^2</m> generalize.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Rotations in <m>\RR^3</m> are no longer about the origin.
          Instead, we have to choose an axis.
          Any line through the origin will do for an axis of rotation.
          Any rotation in <m>\RR^3</m> is determined by an axis of rotation and an angle of rotation about that axis.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Reflections are also altered:
          instead of reflecting over a line,
          we have to reflect over a plane through the origin.
          Any plane through the origin determines a reflection.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Skews are similarly defined:
          one or two directions are fixed and the remaining directions are tilted.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Dialations are also similar,
          though we have three possible directions in which to stretch or compress.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Like <m>\RR^2</m>, we can project onto the origin,
          sending everything to zero, or onto a line,
          sending every point to the closest point on a line.
          Examples include projection onto the axes.
          However, we can also project onto planes.
          Sending <m>(a,b,c)</m> to <m>(a,b,0)</m>, for example,
          removes the <m>z</m> coordinate;
          this is projection onto the <m>xy</m> plane.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
