  <title>Tangent Planes</title>
  <p>
    In single variable calculus,
    derivatives allowed us to find the slopes and equations of tangent lines to the graph of a function.
    We want to extend this idea.
    For functions of two variables,
    we have graphs which are surfaces in <m>\RR^3</m> instead of curves in <m>\RR^2</m>.
    These surfaces have tangent planes instead of tangent lines.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we have such a function <m>f(x,y)</m> let's look at a particular point
    <m>(a,b,f(a,b))</m> on the graph of the function.
    We can calculate the partial derivatives <m>f_x(a,b)</m> and <m>f_y(a,b)</m>.
    At the point <m>(a,b,f(a,b))</m>,
    these two partial derivatives give us the rate of change in <m>x</m> and in <m>y</m>.
    That's the slope of a tangent line in the <m>x</m> direction and a tangent line in the <m>y</m> direction.
    We'd rather have direction vectors than slopes,
    but we can construct these.
    For the <m>x</m> direciton,
    the <m>y</m> coordinate is <m>0</m> since there is no change in <m>y</m>.
    That gives the vector <m>(1, 0, f_x(a,b))</m>.
    Likewise in the <m>y</m> direction,
    we have the vector <m>(0,1,f_y(a,b))</m>.
    These are two tangent local direction vectors.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we have two vectors on a plane,
    the normal of the plane is given by the cross product.
    So we calculate <m>(1,0, f_x(a,b)) \times (0,1, f_y(a,b)) = (-f_x(a,b), -f_y(a,b),1)</m>.
    Therefore, we have the following result.
  </p>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f(x,y)</m> be a function <m>\RR^2 \rightarrow \RR</m>.
        The equation of the tangent plane to <m>f</m> at <m>(a,b,f(a,b))</m> is
        <me>
          z - f(a,b) = f_x(a,b) (x-a) + f_y(a,b) (y-b)
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      We just calculated the normal at any point
      <m>(a,b,f(a,b))</m> on the graph of the function.
      That vector was <m>(-f_x(a,b), -f_y(a,b),1)</m>.
      From <xref ref="standard-forms">Section</xref>
      the equation of the plane is given by the dot product of the variables with the normal.
      Here is this dot product, with an unknown value <m>c</m>.
      <me>
        - f_x(a,b) x - f_y(a,b) y + z = c
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We have a point on the plane: <m>(a,b,f(a,b))</m>.
      By substitution, we can solve for <m>c</m>.
      <me>
        c = f(a,b) - f_x(a,b) a - f_y(a,b) b
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting this <m>c</m> in gives the equation of the plane.
      <me>
        - f_x(a,b) x - f_y(a,b) y + z = f(a,b) - f_x(a,b)a - f_y(a,b)b
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      From here, is it just a re-arrangement to get the form in the proposition.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <example xml:id="example-tangent-plane">

        Consider <m>f(x,y) = \frac{1}{1 + x^2 + y^2}</m>.

          \frac{\del f}{\del x} = \frac{-2x}{(1+x^2+y^2)^2} \hspace{2cm} \frac{\del f}{\del y} = \frac{-2y}{(1+x^2+y^2)^2}

        At the point <m>(x,y) = (1,1)</m>,

    The definition of tangent planes for
    <m>f: \RR^2 \rightarrow \RR</m> extends to as many dimensions as we want.
    A function <m>f: \RR^3 \rightarrow \RR</m> has a graph in <m>\RR^4</m>.
    Its tangent spaces are 3-spaces in <m>\RR^4</m>.
    We can understand those 3-spaces in a very similar method.
    We calcluate the three local tangent directions.
    <me>
      v_1 = \left( 1, 0, 0, \frac{\del f}{\del x} \right) \hspace{2cm} v_2 = \left( 0, 1, 0, \frac{\del f}{\del y} \right) \hspace{2cm} v_3 = \left( 0, 0, 1, \frac{\del f}{\del z} \right)
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    There isn't a cross-product in <m>\RR^4</m>,
    but we can genearlize the pattern in this case to get the normal to the tangent 3-space.
    <me>
      \left( - \frac{\del f}{\del x}, - \frac{\del f}{\del y}, - \frac{\del f}{\del z}, 1 \right)
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    The equation of the tangent 3-space at <m>(a,b,c,f(a,b,c))</m> is
    <me>
      w - f(a,b,c) = \frac{\del f}{\del x}(a,b,c) (x-a) + \frac{\del f}{\del y} (a,b,c) (y-b) + \frac{\del f}{\del z} (a,b,c) (z-c)
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    And we could extend this to <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m>,
    which has a tangent hyperplane in <m>\RR^{n+1}</m>.
    <me>
      v_1 = \left( 1, 0, \ldots, \frac{\del f}{\del x_1} \right) \hspace{1cm} v_2 = \left( 0, 1, 0, \ldots, \frac{\del f}{\del x_2} \right) \hspace{1cm} \ldots \hspace{1cm} v_n = \left( 0, \ldots, 0, 1, \frac{\del f}{\del x_n} \right)
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    The normal to the tangent hyperplane is
    <me>
      \left( - \frac{\del f}{\del x_1}, - \frac{\del f}{\del x_2}, \ldots, - \frac{\del f}{\del x_n}, 1 \right)
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The equation of the tangent hyperplane at <m>(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots,
    a_n, f(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n))</m> is
    <md>
      <mrow>x_0 - f(a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n) \amp  = \frac{\del f}{\del x_1}(a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n ) (x_1-a_2) + \frac{\del f}{\del x_2} (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) (x_2-a_2) + \ldots</mrow>

    To connect tangent (hyper)planes to tangents to parametric curves and derivatives along those curves,
    we have the following result.
  </p>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\gamma(t)</m> be a parametric curve in <m>\RR^{n+1}</m> and
        <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m> a differentiable function.
        Then if <m>\gamma(t)</m> lies on the graph of <m>f</m>,
        the tangents to <m>\gamma(t)</m> must lie on the tangent planes to the graph of <m>f</m>. (All these tangent vectors are local direction vectors).
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the same function as <xref ref="example-tangent-plane">Example</xref>:
        <m>f(x,y) = \frac{1}{1+x^2+y^2}</m>.
        Then consider the parametric curves
        <m>\gamma_1(t) = \left(t,1, \frac{1}{2+t^2} \right)</m> and <m>\gamma_2(t) = \left(1, t, \frac{1}{2+t^2} \right)</m>.
        It is easy to check that both curves lie on the graph of <m>f</m> and both pass through the point <m>\left(1,1,\frac{1}{3} \right)</m> at <m>t=1</m>.
        Then we can calculate the tangents to the curves at that point and the plane they span.
        <men>
          \begin{array}{*4{>{\displaystyle}l}} \gamma_1^\prime(t) \amp  = \left( 1, 0 \frac{-2t}{(2+t^2)^2} \right) \amp \hspace{2cm} \gamma_2^\prime(t) \amp  = \left( 0, 1 \frac{-2t}{(2+t^2)^2} \right) \\[1em] \gamma_1^\prime(1) \amp  = \left( 1, 0, \frac{-2}{9} \right) \amp \hspace{2cm} \gamma_2^\prime(1) \amp  = \left( 0, 1, \frac{-2}{9} \right) \\[1em] \gamma_1^\prime(1) \times \gamma_2^\prime(1) \amp  = \left( \frac{2}{9}, \frac{2}{9}, 1 \right) \amp  \amp \end{array}
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        This gives exactly the same normal at the same point <m>\left( 1,1,\frac{1}{3} \right)</m>,
        so the same plane.
        We can think of tangent planes at the environment for tangents to curves which lie on the graph of the function.
