  <title>The Chain Rule</title>
  <p>
    We defined partial derivatives to measure rates of change in a particular variable.
    We extended this to change in any unit direction with directional derivatives.
    We can extend this even further,
    but considering the change in a function as we move along a
    <em>parametric curve</em> in the domain.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let <m>f(x,y,z): \RR^3 \rightarrow\RR</m>,
    be a potential energy function.
    Let <m>\gamma(t) = (x(t),
    y(t), z(t))</m> be a curve moving through <m>\RR^3</m>.
    If this is a potential energy function,
    we want to know how quickly we gain and/or lose energy moving along the path <m>\gamma</m>.
    The energy along <m>\gamma</m> is <m>f(\gamma(t)) = f(x(t), y(t),
    z(t))</m>.
    The rate of change is <m>\frac{df}{dt}</m>.
    But now <m>f</m> is a composition,
    <m>f(\gamma(t))</m>, so this must be a chain rule calculation.
    What is the chain rule when we have three
    (or more)
    components?.
  </p>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        (The Chain Rule) Let <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m> be a scalar function and
        <m>\gamma(t)</m> a parametric curve in <m>\RR^n</m> inside the domain of <m>f</m>.
        The derivative of <m>f</m> along <m>\gamma</m> is
        <me>
          \frac{d}{dt} f(\gamma(t)) = \frac{\del f}{\del x_1} \frac{dx_1}{dt} + \frac{\del f}{\del x_2} \frac{dx_2}{dt} + \ldots + \frac{\del f}{\del x_n} \frac{dx_n}{dt}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        The total rate of change is the sum of the rates of changes in each of the variables.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <p>
    For reference, here is the chain rule in <m>\RR^3</m>.
    <me>
      \frac{d}{dt} f((x(t), y(t), z(t)) = \frac{\del f}{\del x} \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\del f}{\del y} \frac{dy}{dt} + \frac{\del f}{\del z} \frac{dz}{dt}
    </me>
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the potential gravitational energy function
        <me>
          P = - \frac{GmM}{r} = \frac{-GmM}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        If we move along a curve <m>\gamma</m>,
        it is nice to know how the potential energy changes.
        A helical path out of the gravity well might be <m>\gamma(t) = (\sin t, \cos t, t)</m>.
        We differentiate along this path using the chain rule.
        <md>
          <mrow>\frac{dP}{dt} \amp  = \frac{\del P}{\del x} \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\del P}{\del y} \frac{dy}{dt} + \frac{\del P}{\del z} \frac{dz}{dt}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \frac{GmMx}{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}} \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{GmMy}{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}} \frac{dy}{dt} + \frac{GmMz}{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}} \frac{dz}{dt}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \frac{GmM\sin t}{(1 + t^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}} \cos t + \frac{GmM\cos t}{(1 + t^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}} (-\sin t) + \frac{GmMt}{(1 + t^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}} 1</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \frac{GmMt}{\sqrt{(1+t^2)^3}}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice that if we let <m>|\gamma(t)| = \sqrt{1 + t^2}</m> at the start,
        we could have written <m>P(t) = \frac{-GmM}{|\gamma(t)|} = \frac{-GmM}{\sqrt{1+t^2}}</m> and the
        <m>P^\prime(t) = \frac{GmMt}{\sqrt{(1+t^2)^3}}</m> could have been calculated directly.
        That would have been easier,
        but its nice to get confirmation that working with the chain rule leads to the right result.
