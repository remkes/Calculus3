    First year calculus dealt with functions <m>\RR \rightarrow \RR</m>.
    Parametric curves dealt with functions <m>\RR \rightarrow \RR^n</m>.
    Multivariable functions are functions <m>\RR^n \rightarrow \RR^m</m>.
    They having an arbitrary number of inputs and outputs.
    We can distinguish between two main categories, classified by output.

    Vector functions are the most difficult and complicated,
    since they have both multiple inputs and multiple outputs.
    The study of vector functions is the major topic of Calculus IV. For the remainder of these notes,
    we will restrict our attention to scalar functions.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        There are many familiar scalar functions.
        The potential energy due to gravity on an object with mass <m>m</m> and height <m>h</m> above the surface of the earth is
        <m>PE = mgh</m> is a two variable function.
        In a circuit,
        voltage in terms of current and reisistance is <m>V = IR</m> is another two variable function.
        The force of gravity between two celestial object
        <m>F = -MmG/r^2</m> is a three-variable functions which depends on both masses,
        <m>M</m> and <m>m</m>, as well as the distance between them <m>r</m>.
        Any quantity which can vary in three dimensional space,
        such a pressure, temperature, humidity,
        is a functions of the three variables of location <m>(x,y,z)</m>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Here are some explicit functions <m>\RR^2 \rightarrow \RR</m>.
        <md>
          <mrow>f_1(x,y) \amp  = x-y</mrow>
          <mrow>f_2(x,y) \amp  = \sin (xy)</mrow>
          <mrow>f_3(x,y) \amp  = \frac{1}{2} x^y</mrow>
          <mrow>f_4(x,y) \amp  = x^2 + y^2 - xy</mrow>
          <mrow>f_5(x,y) \amp  = \sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y}</mrow>
          <mrow>f_6(x,y) \amp  = \sqrt{4 - x^2 -y^2}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Any other algebraic expression in <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> would also define a function <m>\RR^2 \rightarrow \RR</m>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>domain</term> of a scalar function
        <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m> is the subset of <m>\RR^n</m> where the function can be defined.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Domain has the same kind of restrictions as for single-variable functions:
    no division by zero, no negative even roots,
    no negative logarithms, etc.
    However, now that the domain restrictions may apply to any of the input variables.
    The domains themselves may be very complicated subsets of <m>\RR^n</m>.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let's look at the domains of the five explicitly stated functions in the <xref ref="example-multivariable1">Example</xref>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>f_1</m> and <m>f_4</m> are polynomials
              (in two variables),
              so there are no restrictions.
              Their domain is <m>\RR^2</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>f_2</m> is a sine function,
              which again imposes no restrictions,
              so it also has domain <m>\RR^2</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>f_5</m> has two square roots,
              one involving <m>x</m> and one involving <m>y</m>.
              Therefore, we need <m>x\geq 0</m> and
              <m>y \geq 0</m> to defined <m>f_5</m>.
              That domain is the positive <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> quadrant,
              including the origin and the positive pieces of both axes.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>f_6</m> also has a square root.
              To ensure that the square root has a positive argument,
              we need <m>4 - x^2 - y^2 \geq 0</m>,
              or <m>x^2 + y^2 \leq 4</m>.
              This domain is a a circular disc of radius <m>2</m>, including its boundary.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Lastly, <m>f_3</m>, has an strange exponential.
              This leads to very strange domain behaviour.
              If <m>y</m> is an integer, <m>x</m> can be any non-zero real number.
              If <m>y</m> is a fraction,
              <m>x</m> must be positive is the denominator of <m>y</m> is even,
              to avoid square roots of negative numbers.
              If <m>y</m> is irrational, <m>x</m> must be positive.
              This all leads to a very complicated domain in <m>\RR^2</m>.
            </p>
