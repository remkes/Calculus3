  <title>Directional Derivatives</title>
  <p>
    Partial derivatives took one variable and pretended that all other variables were constant.
    In that way, we got the rate of change in that variable.
    We could consider <m>\frac{\del f}{\del x}</m> the derivative of <m>f</m> <em>when we move</em>
    in the <m>x</m> axis direction.
    But why do we only need to move in the axis direction?
    Why can't we move in all directions and consider the rate of change?
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m> be a differentiable function and <m>u</m> a
        <term>unit</term> vector in <m>\RR^n</m>.
        The directional derivative of <m>f</m> in the direction <m>u</m> is written <m>D_u f</m> and given by a limit definition.
        Let <m>v</m> be a point in the domain of <m>f</m>.
        <me>
          D_u f(v) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{ f(v + hu) - f(v)}{h}
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    The directional derivative,
    like the partial derivative, uses a single variable limit:
    we use the line in the direction <m>u</m>
    (as a local direction vector form the point <m>v</m>)
    to give a one-dimensional domain <mdash/> a copy of <m>\RR^1</m>.
    Then we just differentiate along the line.
    If <m>u = e_1</m>, we get <m>D_{e_1} f = f_{x_1}</m>.
    If <m>u = e_2</m> we get <m>D_{e_2} f = f_{x_2}</m> and so on.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead of calculating this limit every time,
    we have a nice tool for calculating directional derivatives.

  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m> be a differentiable function and <m>u</m> a
        <em>unit</em> vector in <m>\RR^n</m>.
        The directional derivatives <m>D_u f</m> is the dot product of <m>u</m> with <m>\nabla f</m>.
        <me>
          D_u f = u \cdot \nabla f
        </me>

  <p>
    If <m>(a,b)</m> or <m>(a,b,c)</m> are unit vectors in <m>\RR^2</m> and <m>\RR^3</m>,
    respectively,
    we can write the specific form of the proposition for low dimensions.
    <md>
      <mrow>D_{(a,b)} f(x,y) \amp  = \frac{\del f}{\del x} a + \frac{\del f}{\del y} b</mrow>
      <mrow>D_{(a,b,c)} f(x,y,z) \amp  = \frac{\del f}{\del x} a + \frac{\del f}{\del y} b + \frac{\del f}{\del z} c</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    As we noted above,
    the directional derivatives in the axis directions give the partial derivatives,
    so this is an extension of the idea of partial derivatives.

        Consider this function: <m>f(x,y) = \sin (x^2 + y^2)</m>,
        show in <xref ref="figure-3d-graph3">Figure</xref>.
        These are circular sine waves,
        like riples on a pond which never decrease in amplitude.
        We have

        If we wanted damped ripples instead,
        as in <xref ref="figure-3d-graph4">Figure</xref>,
        we would take <m>f(x,y) = e^{-(x^2 + y^2)} \sin(x^2 + y^2)</m>.
        <md>
          <mrow>D_{(a,b)} f(x,y) \amp  = \left[ -2xe^{-(x^2+y^2)} \sin (x^2 + y^2) + 2xe^{-(x^2+y^2)} \cos (x^2 + y^2) \right] a</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  \hspace{1cm} + \left[ -2ye^{-(x^2+y^2)} \sin (x^2 + y^2) + 2ye^{-(x^2+y^2)} \cos (x^2 + y^2) \right] b</mrow>
          <mrow>D_{(a,b)} f(\sqrt{\pi},\sqrt{\pi}) \amp  = \left[ -2\sqrt{\pi}e^{-(\pi+\pi)} \sin (\pi + \pi) + 2\sqrt{\pi}e^{-(\pi+\pi)} \cos (\pi + \pi) \right] a</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  \hspace{1cm} + \left[ -2\sqrt{\pi}e^{-(\pi + \pi )} \sin (\pi + \pi ) + 2\sqrt{\pi}e^{-(\pi + \pi )} \cos (\pi + \pi) \right] b</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \frac{2\sqrt{\pi}}{e^{2\pi}} \left[ \cos (2\pi) a + \cos (2\pi) b \right] = \frac{2 \sqrt{\pi} (a+b)}{e^{2\pi}}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    Finally, look at what happens when we apply the length of a dot product to the directional derivative.
    <me>
      |D_u f| = |\nabla f \cdot u| = |\nabla f||u| \cos \theta
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    The cosine term is maximized when the angle <m>\theta =0</m>, that is,
    when <m>u</m> is the unit vector in the same direction as <m>\nabla f</m>.
    That is, the greatest directional derivative,
    representing the direction of fastest change,
    is found in the direction of the gradient.
    This established the fact, which we claimed earlier,
    that the gradient points in the direction of greatest change.
