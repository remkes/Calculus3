  <title>Polar Coordinates</title>
  <p>
    In <m>\RR^2</m>,
    the most common non-linear coordinate system is polar coordinates.
    Polar coordinates describe <m>\RR^2</m> in terms of circles and rays instead of the conventional lines of Cartesian coordinates.
    The system has two parameters (coordinates):
    <m>r</m> and <m>\theta</m>.
    <m>r</m>, the radius, is the distance of a point from the origin.
    We have <m>r \in [0, \infty)</m>,
    since that distance can't be negative.
    If we draw a ray from the origin to a point,
    <m>\theta</m> is the angle between that line and the <m>x</m> axis,
    with the convention that <m>\theta \in [0, 2\pi)</m>.

    We would like to be able to move between Cartesian and polar coordinates.
    To that end,
    we need to describe <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in terms of <m>r</m> and <m>\theta</m>,
    and vice-versa.
    The relationships are just trigonometry.
    <me>
      x = r \cos \theta \hspace{2cm} y = r \sin \theta
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    The reverse direction is also trigonometry.
    <me>
      r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \hspace{2cm} \tan \theta = \frac{y}{x} \implies \theta = \arctan \frac{y}{x}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    If <m>x</m> is zero, then <m>\tan \theta</m> is undefined,
    but <m>\theta</m> will be <m>\pi/2</m> or <m>3\pi/2</m>,
    depending on whether <m>y</m> is positive or negative.
    If <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both zero, at the origin,
    the angle is not defined at all.
  </p>
  <p>
    Loci in <m>\RR^2</m> are equations in <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
    The simplest such loci were <m>x=c</m>,
    which is a vertical line, and <m>y=c</m>,
    which is a horizontal line.
    We get loci in <m>\RR^2</m> in terms of <m>r</m> and <m>\theta</m> as well.
    <m>r=c</m> is a circle: the shape with any angle and a fixed radius.
    <m>\theta =c</m> is a ray: the shape with a fixed angle and any radius.

    show some exammples of loci in polar coordinates.
  </p>
  <p>
    To translate between loci in polar coordinates and loci in Cartesian coordinates is simply a matter of replacement.
    The line <m>x=4</m> in Cartesian coordinates becomes
    <m>r\cos \theta = 4</m> or <m>\cos \theta = \frac{r}{4}</m>.
    The circle <m>x^2 + y^2 =1</m> becomes <m>r^2 \cos^2 \theta + r^2 \sin^2 \theta = 1</m>,
    which is simply <m>r^2 = 1 \implies r=1</m>.
    The polar locus <m>r=\theta</m> becomes <m>\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \arctan \frac{y}{x}</m>.
