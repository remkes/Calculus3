  <title>Extrema and Optimization</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In Calculus I, one of the first applications of derivatives was optimization.
      The same is true in this course.
      In this chapter,
      we'll build the techniques that let us find the maximum and minimum values of multivariable funtions.
