      Kepler's laws were originally formulated from the observations of planets in the night sky and were written down before Newton.
      One of the triumphs of Newtonian mechanics is the recovery of Kepler's laws.
      In this section,
      we start with Newton's gravity and derive Kepler's laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kepler described three laws of planetary motion.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Satellites in orbit around a large gravity source have elliptical orbits with the large object at one of the foci of the ellipse.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The radius of a satellite sweeps out equal area over time.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The period <m>T</m> of a satellite and the major axis <m>a</m> of the associated ellipse satisfy
            <m>T^2 = \alpha a^3</m> for some constant <m>\alpha</m> depending only upon the mass of the large object.

    <title>Kepler's First Law</title>
    <p>
      The setup for approaching Kepler's laws is show in <xref ref="figure-keplers-laws">Figure</xref>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            We have a large stationary object of mass <m>M</m>,
            and a small object of mass <m>m</m> in orbit around the larger object.
            We must assume that <m>m \ll M</m> to allow the larger object to be essentially stationary.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We place the stationary object of mass <m>M</m> at the origin in <m>\RR^3</m>.
            We might work in the plane since the orbits are planar,
            but it is more useful to think of the orbit sitting in the <m>xy</m> plane in <m>\RR^3</m>.
            This will be important,
            since it turns out to be useful to consider the perperdicular direction to the plane of orbit and use normals and binormals in <m>\RR^3</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The curve <m>\gamma(t) = (r(t),\theta(t),z(t))</m> decribes the motion of the orbiting object over time,
            in cylindrical coordinates
            (which reduce to polar coordinates in the <m>xy</m> plane).
            In the third coordinate <m>z(t)</m>,
            we expect that <m>z(t) = 0</m> at all times <m>t</m>
            (which will produce a curve in the <m>xy</m> plane in polar coordinates),
            but we don't assume this.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The curve <m>\gamma(t)</m> is unknown and we wish to derive it from Newtonian physics.
            We will prove Kelper's laws using the derived curve.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The force of gravity has magnitude
            <me>
              F = \frac{GmM}{|\gamma(t)|^2} = \frac{GmM}{r(t)^2}
            </me>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The direction of the force is <m>-\gamma(t)</m>,
            since the force wishes to pull the object back towards the origin.
            Since we want just direction without changing magnitude,
            we use the unit vector <m>u(t) = \gamma(t) / |\gamma(t)|</m> for the direction of <m>\gamma(t)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Newton's first law <m>F = ma</m> applies, so the acceleration is
            <me>
              a(t) = \frac{-GM}{|\gamma(t)|^2} u(t) = \frac{-GM}{|\gamma(t)|^3} \gamma(t)
            </me>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Acceleration is the second derivative of position,
            therefore Newton's first law becomes
            <me>
              \frac{d^2}{dt^2} \gamma(t) = \frac{-GM}{|\gamma(t)|^3} \gamma(t)
            </me>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We write <m>h(t) = \gamma(t) \times \gamma^\prime(t)</m>.
            <m>h(t)</m> is in the binormal direction,
            but is not necessarily a unit vector.
            This seems like a strange definition,
            but the vector <m>h</m> turns out to be very useful in the proof.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Newton's law is a multivariable differential equation;
      solving it directly is very difficult and well beyond the scope of this course.
      Our approach is indirect.
      We start with two seeminly random calculations.
      For convenience of notation, we often drop the <m>t</m> variable,
      writing <m>\gamma</m> instead of
      <m>\gamma(t)</m> and likewise for other functions of <m>t</m>.

    <lemma xml:id="lemma-reference1">
      <statement>
        <me>
          \frac{d}{dt} h(t) = 0

    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dt} h(t) = \frac{d}{dt} \gamma \times \gamma^\prime =
        \frac{d\gamma}{dt} \times \gamma^\prime + \gamma \times

        = \gamma^\prime \times \gamma^\prime + \gamma \times a
      </me>
      <p>
        The first term <m>\gamma^\prime \times \gamma^\prime = 0</m> since any vector with itself in the cross product is <m>0</m>.
        Then <m>\gamma</m> and the acceleration <m>a</m> are in the same direction
        (up to <m>\pm1</m>),
        since the force pulls back towards the origin.
        Vectors in the same direction likewise have <m>0</m> cross product.
        Therefore, we have <m>\frac{d}{dt} h = 0</m>.

          This is exactly the same as <xref ref="equation-conic-eccentricity-form">Equation</xref>.
          By <xref ref="prop-conic-eccentricity">Proposition</xref>
          such forms describe all conics,
          so Kepler's First Law states that orbital paths are conics.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We start with Newton's First Law as a differential equation,
        using the force of gravity on the right side.
        <me>
          a = \frac{-GM}{|\gamma|^2} u
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's take the cross product with <m>h</m>.
        We use <xref ref="lemma-reference2">Lemma</xref> on the right side.
        <md>
          <mrow>a \times h \amp  = \frac{-GM}{|\gamma|^2} u \times h = \frac{-GM}{|\gamma|^2} u \times \left( |\gamma|^2 (u \times u^\prime) \right)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \frac{-GM}{|\gamma|^2} |\gamma|^2 \left( u \times \left( u \times u^\prime \right) \right) = -GM \left( u \times \left( u \times u^\prime \right) \right)</mrow>
          <intertext>We use <xref ref="prop-triple-cross-product">Proposition</xref> to expand the triple cross product on the right side.</intertext>
          <mrow>a \times h \amp  = -GM ((u\cdot u^\prime) u - (u \cdot u) u^\prime))</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>u</m> is always a unit vector,
        we can apply <xref ref="lemma-unit-vector-derivative">Lemma</xref>,
        which says that <m>u \times u^\prime = 0</m>.
        Also since <m>u</m> is a unit vector,
        <m>u \cdot u = |u|^2 = 1</m>.
        This deals with both of the dot products.
        <men xml:id="equation-reference4">
          a \times h = -GM ( 0 u - 1 u^\prime) = GM u^\prime
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then we consider the following derivative.
        <me>
          \frac{d}{dt} (\gamma^\prime \times h) = \frac{d\gamma^\prime}{dt} \times h + \gamma^\prime \times \frac{dh}{dt}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        The first term here is <m>a \times h</m>,
        since <m>a</m> is <m>\frac{d\gamma^\prime}{dt}</m>.
        The second term involves the derivative of <m>h</m>.
        But <xref ref="lemma-reference1">Lemma</xref>
        said that the derivative of <m>h</m> is zero, so this term vanishes.
        <me>
          \frac{d}{dt} (\gamma^\prime \times h) = a \times h
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then let's replace <m>a \times h</m> with the expression from <xref ref="equation-reference4">Equation</xref>.
        <me>
          \frac{d}{dt} (\gamma^\prime \times h) = GM u^\prime
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we've made progress with our difficult differential equation:
        we have a time derivative on both sides.
        We can simply integrate both sides to give
        <m>\gamma^\prime \times h = GM u + c</m>. where <m>c</m> is a <em>vector</em>
        of constants of integration. (That vector corresponds to intial conditions of position and velocity).
        We take the dot product with <m>\gamma</m>.
        <me>
          \gamma \cdot (\gamma^\prime \times h) = GM (u \cdot \gamma) + \gamma \cdot c = GM |\gamma| u \cdot u + |\gamma| |c| \cos \theta = GM + |\gamma| |c| \cos \theta
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here <m>\theta</m> is the angle between <m>\gamma</m> and <m>c</m>.
        Since we haven't specified a starting point,
        we can choose coordinates such that <m>c</m> is in the positive <m>x</m> direction,
        which means that this <m>\theta</m> is the usual <m>\theta</m> of polar coordinates and
        <m>|\gamma|</m> is the usual <m>r</m> of polar coodinates.
        <md>
          <mrow>\gamma \cdot (\gamma^\prime \times h) \amp  = GM |\gamma| + |\gamma| |c| \cos \theta</mrow>
          <intertext>We solve for <m>|\gamma|</m>.</intertext>
          <mrow>|\gamma| \amp  = \frac{\gamma \cdot (\gamma^\prime \times h) } { GM + |c| \cos \theta}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        The expression <m>|c|/GM</m> is a constant, so let's give it a label.
        <men xml:id="equation-reference8">
          e \defeq \frac{|c|}{GM}
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's switch the <m>|\gamma|</m> for <m>r</m> as well.
        <me>
          r = \frac{\gamma \cdot (\gamma^\prime \times h) } { GM + |c| \cos \theta} = \frac{\gamma \cdot (\gamma^\prime \times h) } { 1 + e \cos \theta} \left( \frac{1}{GM} \right)
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        The numerator involves <m>\gamma \cdot (\gamma^\prime \times h)</m>,
        which we can rearrange to <m>h \cdot (\gamma \times \gamma^\prime)</m> using <xref ref="prop-cross-dot-product">Proposition</xref>.
        But <m>(\gamma \times \gamma^\prime)</m> is the definition of <m>h</m>,
        so this dot product is <m>h\cdot h = |h|^2</m>.
        <men xml:id="equation-reference10">
          r = \frac{|h|^2 } { 1 + e \cos \theta} \left( \frac{1}{GM} \right)
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>|h|^2</m> is a constant,
        since <m>h</m> doesn't change according to <xref ref="lemma-reference1">Lemma</xref>.
        Let's make another definition.
        <men xml:id="equation-reference9">
          d = |h|^2/|c|
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        We can then replace the nuemrator of <xref ref="equation-reference10">Equation</xref> using <m>d</m>.
        <me>
          r = \frac{d|c|} { 1 + e \cos \theta} \left( \frac{1}{GM} \right) = \frac{d} { 1 + e \cos \theta} \left( \frac{|c|}{GM} \right)
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Replace <m>\frac{|c|}{GM}</m> by <m>e</m>,
        since that's how we defined <m>e</m> in <xref ref="equation-reference8">Equation</xref>.
        <me>
          r = \frac{ed } { 1 + e \cos \theta}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the desired form.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      The eccentricity was defined as <m>e = |c|/GM</m>.
      Notice that the eccentricity depends on the constants of integration.
      That makes sense since those constants determine inital position and velocity.
      If <m>e\lt 1</m>, then the initial conditions indicate an ellipse.
      If <m>e \geq1</m> then we get a hyperbola.
      The difference is precisely the notion of escape velocity <mdash/> these initial conditions tell us if the satellite has enough initial energy to escape or be trapped in orbit.
      If trapped in orbit, the orbits are elliptical.
      If escaping, the path is parabolic or hyperbolic.
      We will assume that the orbits are elliptical,
      i.e., that the original velocity is less than escape velocity,
      to prove the final two laws.

    <proof>
      <p>
        Write <m>A(t)</m> for the area swept out in this way.
        Our goal is to prove that <m>A^\prime(t)</m> is constant.
        We approach this by looking at the infinitesimal area <m>dA</m> swept out over an infinitesimal time interval <m>dt</m>.
        Such an area is a small triangle,
        shown in gray in <xref ref="figure-sweeping-area">Figure</xref>.
        It has side length <m>r</m> and base <m>db</m>,
        which we can assume is perpendicular to the radius.
        Therefore, the area <m>dA</m> of the infinitesimal triangle is <m>\frac{1}{2} r db</m>.
        Then <m>db</m>, as an infinitesimal arclength, is <m>rd\theta</m>,
        so <m>dA = \frac{1}{2} r^2 d\theta</m>, which we can integrate

        We take the magnitude of this vector.
        (We choose a direction of orbit for that <m>\frac{d\theta}{dt}</m> is positive.)
        <me>
          |h| = |\gamma(t)|^2 \frac{d\theta}{dt} = r(t)^2 \frac{d\theta}{dt}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now this looks familiar:
        if has the same right side as <xref ref="equation-reference6">Equation</xref>.
        Therefore, it is equation to the left side of that equation.
        <m>\frac{dA}{dt}</m>.
        <me>
          \frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} |h|
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        But we know that <m>h</m> is constant by <xref ref="lemma-reference1">Lemma</xref>.
        Therefore, the rate of change of the area <m>A</m> must be constant.

        <p>
          (Kepler's Third Law) The period <m>T</m> of the revolution and the semi-major axis <m>a</m> of the ellipse satisfy
          <m>T^2 = \alpha a^3</m> for some constant <m>\alpha</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We start with the last equation in the previous proof.
        <me>
          A(t) = \frac{|h|}{2} t
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        The period <m>T</m> is the time needed to complete one whole orbit.
        The area swept out over time <m>T</m> should be the whole ellipse.
        Recall an ellipse with semiaxes <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> has area <m>\pi a b</m>.
        We make the two areas equal.
        <men xml:id="equation-reference11">
          A(T) = \frac{|h|T}{2} = \pi a b \implies T = \frac{2\pi ab}{|h|} \implies T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 a^2 b^2}{|h|^2}
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        From <xref ref="equation-reference7">Equation</xref>,
        we have expressions for the semimajor and semiminor axes (<m>a</m> and <m>b</m>) in terms of the eccentricity <m>e</m> and the distance <m>d</m> from the focus to the directrix.
        <me>
          a^2 = \frac{e^2 d^2}{(1-e^2)^2} \hspace{2cm} b^2 = \frac{e^2 d^2}{1-e^2}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        We take the square root of <m>a^2</m> and then the ratio of the two equations.
        <men xml:id="equation-reference12">
          \frac{a}{b^2} = \frac{\frac{ed}{(1-e^2)}}{\frac{e^2d^2}{1-e^2}} = \frac{1}{ed} \implies ed = \frac{b^2}{a}
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we can relate <m>ed</m> to <m>G</m>, <m>M</m> and <m>h</m>.
        Recall the definition of <m>e</m> from <xref ref="equation-reference8">Equation</xref>
        and <m>d</m> from <xref ref="equation-reference10">Equation</xref>.
        We calculate the product <m>ed</m>.
        <men>
          ed = \frac{|h|^2}{GM} \implies |h|^2 = edGM
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        We use this to substitute for <m>|h|^2</m> in <xref ref="equation-reference11"></xref>.
        <me>
          T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 a^2 b^2}{GMed}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then use <xref ref="equation-reference12">Equation</xref>
        to substitute for <m>ed</m> and simplify.
        <me>
          T^2= \frac{4\pi^2 a^2 b^2}{\frac{GMb^2}{a}} = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} a^3
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the desired result.
        The proportionality constant is <m>\frac{4\pi^2}{GM}</m>,
        which is certainly constant.
      </p>
