  <title>Non-Linear Coordinate Systems</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      One way of thinking of transformations of <m>\RR^n</m> is as changes of coordinates.
      In <m>\RR^2</m>, with standard coordinates <m>x,y</m>,
      we can think of a linear transformation,
      say <m>u = x+v</m> and <m>v=x-v</m>,
      as a new system of coordinates.
      We can describe points, loci,
      and any other objects in terms of <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> just as well as in terms of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
      The transformation tells us how to go between the two sets of coordinates.

    <p>
      All the linear transformations mentioned in the previous section
      (at least those which preserve dimension)
      are changes of coordinates.
      In this section,
      we look at changing to new coordinates in stranger ways;
      in particular, we look as non-linear transformations.
