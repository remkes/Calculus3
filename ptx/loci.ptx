          Consider any set of linear equations in the variables <m>x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n</m>.
          The <term>locus</term> in <m>\RR^n</m> of this set of equations is the set of vectors which satisfy
          <term>all</term> of the equations.
          The plural of locus is <term>loci</term>.

      In general, the equations can be of any sort.
      The unit circle in <m>\RR^2</m> is most commonly defined as the locus of the equation <m>x^2 + y^2 = 1</m>.
      The graph of a function is the locus of the equation <m>y = f(x)</m>.
      However, in linear algebra, we exclude curved objects.
      We're concerned with linear/affine objects:
      things which are straight and flat.

        <p>
          A <term>linear equation</term> in variables
          <m>x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n</m> is an equation of the form
          <me>
            a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \ldots + a_n x_n = c
          </me>.
          where <m>a_i</m> and <m>c</m> are real numbers
        </p>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Any linear or affine subspace of <m>\RR^n</m> can be described as the locus of some number of linear equations.
          Likewise, any locus of any number of linear equations is either an affine subspace of <m>\RR^n</m> or the empty set.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      The best way to think about loci is in terms of restrictions.
      We start with all of <m>\RR^n</m> as the locus of no equations,
      or of the equation <m>0=0</m>.
      There are no restrictions.
      Then we introduce equations.
      Each equation is a restriction on the available points.
      If we work in <m>\RR^2</m>,
      adding the equation <m>x=3</m> restricts us to a vertical line passing through the <m>x</m>-axis at <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> . Likewise,
      if we were to use the equation <m>y=4</m>,
      we would have a horizontal line passing through the <m>y</m>-axis at <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> . If we consider the locus of
      <em>both</em> equations,
      we have only one point remaining:
      <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> is the only point that satisfies both equations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way,
      each additional equation potentially adds an additional restriction and leads to a smaller linear or affine subspace.
      The next three definitions give familiar names for loci with one equation,
      hence one restriction.

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>line</term> in <m>\RR^2</m> is the locus of the equation
          <m>ax + by = c</m> for <m>a,b,c \in \RR</m>.
          In general, the line is affine.
          The line is a linear subspace if <m>c=0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>plane</term> in <m>\RR^3</m> is the locus of the linear equation <m>ax + by + cz = d</m>.
          In general, the plane is affine.
          The plane is a linear subspace if <m>d=0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      If we think of a plane in <m>\RR^3</m> as the locus of one linear equation,
      then the important dimensional fact about a plane is not that it has dimension two but that it has dimension one less than its ambient space <m>\RR^3</m>.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>hyperplane</term> in <m>\RR^n</m> is the locus of one linear equation:
          <m>a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \ldots + a_n x_n = c</m>.
          It has dimension <m>n-1</m>.
          It is, in general, affine.
          The hyperplane is a linear subspace if <m>c=0</m>.

    <title>Intersection</title>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are sets,
          their intersection <m>A \cap B</m> is the set of all points they have in common.
          The intersection of affine subspaces is also an affine subspace.
          If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are both linear subspaces,
          the intersection is also a linear subspace.

          Loci can easily be understood as intersections.
          Consider the locus of two equations,
          say the example we have from <m>\RR^2</m> before:
          the locus of <m>x=3</m> and <m>y=4</m>.
          We defined this directly as a single locus.
          However, we could just as easily think of this as the intersection of the two lines given by <m>x=3</m> and <m>y=4</m> seperately.
          In this way, it is the intersection of two loci.
          Similarly, all loci are the intersection of planes or hyperplanes.
