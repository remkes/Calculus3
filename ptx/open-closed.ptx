  <title>Open and Closed Sets</title>

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>S</m> be a set.
        A <term>topology</term> on <m>S</m> is a choice of subsets which are open and which subsets are closed.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    We need two definitions to allow us to define open and clsoed sets in <m>\RR^n</m>.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>\RR^n</m>.
        A point <m>a \in A</m> is called an
        <term>interior point</term>
        if there exists <m>\epsilon > 0</m> such that all points <m>b</m> with
        <m>|a-b|\lt \epsilon</m> are also in <m>A</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    A point is an interior point if all nearby points are also in the set.
    Around an interior point,
    we can move a little bit in any direction and remain inside the set.
    This <m>\epsilon</m> measures exactly how little the little bit of movement is.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>\RR^n</m>.
        A point <m>a</m>
        (not necessarily in the set)
        is called a <term>boundary point</term>
        if for any <m>\epsilon > 0</m> there exists points <m>b_1</m> and <m>b_2</m> such that both <m>|b_i - a|\lt \epsilon</m>,
        <m>b_1</m> is in the set, but <m>b_2</m> isn't.
        The <term>boundary</term> of a set is the set of all its boundary point.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    A point is a boundary point if there are nearby points in the set and nearby points not in the set.
    Nearby means within some small distance,
    measured by the small positive number <m>\epsilon</m>.
    The two definitions are mutually exclusive:
    a point cannot be both an interior and a boundary point for a set. (It can,
    of course,
    be neither).
    These two definitions allow us to define open and closed sets in <m>\RR^n</m>.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>\RR^n</m>.
        Then <m>A</m> is called <term>open</term>
        is all of its points are interior points.
        Equivalently, <m>A</m> does not contin any boundary points.
        Alternatively, <m>A</m> is called <term>closed</term>
        if it contains all of its boundary points
        (or, equivalently, if it contains its boundary).
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    This definition properly extends the notions of open and closed intervals in <m>\RR</m>.
    The boundary points of an interval are the endpoints.
    The open intervals lacks their endpoints and the closed intervals included their endpoints.
    In <m>\RR^n</m>,
    the boundaries are much more complicated than endpoints:
    they can be intricate geometric shapes.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The sphere <m>S^{n-1}</m> in <m>\RR^n</m> is all vectors of length one.
        The closed ball <m>B^{n}</m> in <m>\RR^n</m> is all vectors of length one or less.
        The sphere <m>S^{n-1}</m>is the boundary of the closed ball <m>B^n</m>,
        and the closed ball is closed because all points of the sphere are all contained in the closed ball.
