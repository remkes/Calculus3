  <title>Introduction</title>

    The major goal of this course is the extension of calculus to functions with multiple variable inputs and/or outputs.
    In <xref ref="vector-geometry">Chapter</xref>,
    we introduced linear transformation,
    which were function <m>\RR^n \rightarrow \RR^m</m>,
    but we would like to also investigate non-linear functions.
    Parametric curves are the first foray;
    we allow a single-input function to have a multi-variable non-linear output.
    We interpreted parametric curves as vectors or positions in some euclidean space;
    as such, parametric curves are used to talk about motion through space.
    The calculus of parametric curves is a way to understand the physics of such motion,
    covering both linear and angular velocity and acceleration in a nice,
    holistic approach.
    When considering parametric curves,
    we should imagine the movement of point-like objects through space under the influence of various forces.
    Projectiles with gravity and air friction is one imporant example;
    the motions of planets, moons and satellite under gravity is another.

    Considering the motion of stellar objects around a large gravity source
    (such as planets, asteroids and comets around the sun),
    we will use the caluculus of parametric curves to derive Kepler's laws of planetary motion from the basic assumptions of Newtonian mechanics.
    Kepler's laws predate Newton,
    but they were simply observed, not derived.
    The fact that Newton's physics,
    with multivariable calculus,
    can recover these observations from first principles of motion and gravity is a major accomplishment of that theory.
    In order to cover Kepler's laws in full,
    these notes also include descriptions of conics as parametric curves.
