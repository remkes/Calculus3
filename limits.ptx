  <title>Limits of Multivariable Functions</title>
  <p>
    We want to re-establish the tools of calculus for multi-variable functions.
    As with single-variable functions,
    our starting point is limits.
    Let's start with the full, formal,
    <m>\epsilon-\delta</m> definition.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m> be a function.
        Let <m>(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)</m> be a point in <m>\RR^n</m>.
        Then the statement
        <me>
          \lim_{(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) \rightarrow (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)} f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = L
        </me>
        means that <m>\forall \epsilon > 0</m> <m>\exists \delta > 0</m> such that if
        <m>|(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) - (a_1, a_2, \ldots,
        a_n)| \lt \delta</m> then <m>|f(x_1, x_2, \ldots,
        x_n) - L| \lt  \epsilon</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    The definition is essentially the same as the single-variable definition:
    as the input gets closer and closer to a specific point,
    the output gets closer and closer to a fixed value <m>L</m>.
    The only issue is that <sq>closer and closer</sq> now happens in <m>\RR^n</m> instead of <m>\RR</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In <m>\RR</m>, we only had two directions of approach:
    from the left and from the right.
    If the behaviour from both sides was the same,
    we said the limit existed.
    In <m>\RR^n</m> for <m>n \geq 2</m>,
    we have infinitely many ways to approach any given point.
    We can approach along lines in infinitely many directions out from the point.
    Even more, we can approach along other paths,
    such as spiral paths or stranger jagged paths.
    This makes it much more difficult to determine the behaviour and much more difficult to prove existence of various limits.
    However, we do have some good news.
    First, the definition of continuity remains the same.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A function <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m> is called continuous at
        <m>(a_1, a_2, \ldots,
        a_n)</m> if the limit approaching
        <m>(a_1,a_2, \ldots,
        a_n)</m> exists and is the same as <m>f(a_1,a_2, \ldots,
        a_n)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    So limits for continuous functions are still reasonable:
    we just evaluate.
    But what functions are continuous?
  </p>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A function <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m> is continuous if and only if it is continuous independently in each of its variables.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <p>
    This is the first application of a very important technique:
    treating the function as a function of only one of the variables and ignoring the other,
    pretending that they are constant.
    If we do that,
    we get <m>n</m> different single variable functions.
    The proposition says that the function is continuous in the new definition if and only if all of the <m>n</m> different single variable functions are continuous.
  </p>
  <p>
    This proposition tells us how to recognize continuous functions.
    Anything involving polynomials,
    roots, rational functions, trig,
    exponentials and logarithms is continuous on its domain.
  </p>
  <p>
    As we mentioned before, proving the existence of limits is difficult.
    However, the algebraic techniques of first year calculus can still work for calculations.
    Here are some examples.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <md>
        <mrow>\lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (0,0)} \frac{x^2 - y^2}{x-y} \amp  =
        \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (0,0)} \frac{(x-y)(x+y)}{(x-y)}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (0,0)} x+y = 0 + 0 = 0</mrow>
        <mrow>\lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (4,1)} \frac{ xy - 4y^2}{\sqrt{x} -
        2\sqrt{y}} \amp  =
        \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (4,1)} \frac{y(\sqrt{x} -
        2\sqrt{y})(\sqrt{x} + 2 \sqrt{y})}{\sqrt{x} - 2\sqrt{y}}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (4,1)} \sqrt{x} + 2 \sqrt{y} =
        \sqrt{4} + 2 \sqrt{1} = 2 + 2 = 4</mrow>
      </md>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <figure xml:id="figure-3d-graph2">
    <caption>The graph of <m>f(x) = \frac{(x+y)^2}{x^2+y^2}</m></caption>
    <image width="1200%" source="images/figure38.png" />
  </figure>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <me>
        \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (0,0)} \frac{(x+y)^2}{x^2 + y^2}
      </me>
      <p>
        Let's approach this along the line <m>y = mx</m>.
        That lets us replace <m>y</m> with <m>mx</m> in the calculation and the limit becuase <m>x \rightarrow 0</m>.
        <md>
          <mrow>\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{(x+mx)^2}{x^2 + m^2x^2} \amp  = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{x^2 + 2mx + m^2 x^2}{x^2 + m^2 x^2}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{x^2(1+m)^2}{x^2(1+m^2)} = \frac{(1+m)^2}{1+m^2}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        This limit depend on the choice of <m>m</m>!
        We can get infinitely many values
        (all between 0 and 1)
        out of this limit depending on which line we use to approach <m>(0,0)</m>.
        With all these possible answers, the limit cannot exist.
        It is interesting to try to visualize the graph:
        as we get close to zero,
        there are pieces of the graph getting close to any number between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>.
        <xref ref="figure-3d-graph2">Figure</xref> shows some of this behaviour:
        approaching from the front of figure leads to <m>0</m>,
        but approaching from the sides leads to larger numbers.
        (The graph is slightly flawed,
        due to the graphing algorithm.
        The two cliffs should meet, even though the graph shows a gap between them.
        Where the two cliffs meet is the line with all the problematic limits.)

      <p>
        In this example,
        we approach along parabolic paths of the form <m>x = m y^2</m> and,
        like the previous example, get a limit that depends on the path of approach.
        <me>
          \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (0,0)} \frac{3xy^2}{x^2 + y^2} = \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (0,0)} \frac{3xy^2}{x^2 + y^2} = \lim_{y \rightarrow 0} \frac{3my^4}{m^2 y^4 + y^4} = \frac{3m}{m+1}
        </me>
      </p>

    <statement>
      <md>
        <mrow>\lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (1,2)} \frac{\sqrt{y} -
        \sqrt{x+1}}{y-x-1} \amp  =
        \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (1,2)} \frac{y-x-1}{(y-x-1)(\sqrt{y} +
        \sqrt{x+1})}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}</mrow>
      </md>
    </statement>
  </example>

    <statement>
      <p>
        Sometime we can make reasonable conclusion independent of path.
        <me>
          \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (0,0)} \frac{\sin(x+y)}{x+y}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        We can assume any path <m>y = f(x)</m> of approach and still set <m>u = x+y</m>,
        which turns this into a limit of <m>\sin(u)/u</m>, which tends to 1.
