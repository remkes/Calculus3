      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>\RR</m>.
        A <term>vector valued function</term>
        is a function <m>f: A \rightarrow \RR^n</m> for <m>n \geq 2</m>.
        It has a single-variable real input,
        but outputs a vector in some higher dimensional space.
        A vector valued function can be written as a vector of individual functions.
        <me>
          f(t) = (f_1(t), f_2(t), \ldots, f_n(t))
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        The function <m>f_i</m> are called the
        <term>component functions</term>
        of the vector-valued function.
        In <m>\RR^2</m>,
        the components will often be written <m>(x(t), y(t))</m>,
        and similarly in <m>\RR^3</m>,
        <m>(x(t), y(t), z(t))</m>.

    The single-variable component functions allow us to quickly extend many notions from single-variable calculus to vector-valued functions.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>limit</term> of a vector valued function is simply the limit of each component.
        <me>
          \lim_{t \rightarrow a} f(t) = \left( \lim_{t \rightarrow a} f_1 (t), \lim_{t \rightarrow a} f_2 (t), \ldots, \lim_{t \rightarrow a} f_2 (t) \right)
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Recall that a single variable function <m>f(t)</m> is continuous at <m>a \in \RR</m> if
    <me>
      \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = f(a)
    </me>.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A vector-valued function is <term>continuous</term>
        if and only if each component function is continuous.
      </p>
    </statement>

      <p>
        The <term>derivative</term> of a vector valued function
        <m>f: A \rightarrow \RR^n</m> is calculated in each component.
        <me>
          \frac{df}{dt} = f^\prime(t) = \left( \frac{df_1}{dt}, \frac{df_2}{dt}, \ldots, \frac{df_n}{dt} \right)
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        We state this explicitly,
        for <m>f(x) = (x(t),y(t))</m> with values in <m>\RR^2</m>.
        <me>
          f^\prime(t) = \frac{d}{dt} f(t) = \left( \frac{dx}{dt}, \frac{dy}{dt}\right)
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise, we give the explicit form for
        <m>f(t) = (x(t),
        y(t),z(t))</m> with values in <m>\RR^3</m>.
        <me>
          f^\prime(t) = \frac{d}{dt} f(t) = \left( \frac{dx}{dt}, \frac{dy}{dt}, \frac{dz}{dt} \right)
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Similarly, the integral of <m>f</m> is defined componentwise.
        <me>
          \int f(t) dt = \left( \int f_1(t) dt, \int f_2(t) dt, \ldots, \int f_n(t) dt \right)
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        We state this explicitly,
        for <m>f(x) = (x(t),y(t))</m> with values in <m>\RR^2</m>.
        <me>
          \int f(t) dt = \left( \int x(t) dt, \int y(t) dt \right)
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise, we give the explicit form for
        <m>f(x) = (x(t),y(t),z(t))</m> with values in <m>\RR^3</m>.
        <me>
          \int f(t) dt = \left( \int x(t) dt, \int y(t) dt, \int z(t) dt \right)
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    The result of a derivative or integral of a vector valued function is still a vector.
    This may seem odd from the viewpoint of first year calculus,
    where derivatives and integrals measured quantifiable geometric properties,
    such as slopes of tangent lines and areas under curves.
    Since the answers here are vectors instead of scalars,
    we will eventually reconsider those interpretations.
    A major challenge in extending calculus to several variables is the need to re-adjust our interpretation and intuition concerning derivatives and integrals.
    The derivative is no longer the slope of a tangent line.
