    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>\RR</m>. A <term>vector valued
        function</term> is a function <m>f: A \rightarrow \RR^n</m>
        for <m>n \geq 2</m>. It has a single-variable real input, but
        outputs a vector in some higher dimensional space. A vector
        valued function can be written as a vector of individual
        functions.
        <me>
          f(t) = (f_1(t), f_2(t), \ldots, f_n(t))
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        The function <m>f_i</m> are called the <term>component
        functions</term> of the vector-valued function. In
        <m>\RR^2</m>, the components will often be written <m>(x(t),
        y(t))</m>, and similarly in <m>\RR^3</m>, <m>(x(t), y(t),
        z(t))</m>.

    The single-variable component functions allow us to quickly extend
    many notions from single-variable calculus to vector-valued
    functions.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>limit</term> of a vector valued function is simply
        the limit of each component.
        <me>
          \lim_{t \rightarrow a} f(t) = \left( \lim_{t \rightarrow a}
          f_1 (t), \lim_{t \rightarrow a} f_2 (t), \ldots, \lim_{t
          \rightarrow a} f_2 (t) \right)
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Recall that a single variable function <m>f(t)</m> is continuous
    at <m>a \in \RR</m> if
    <me>
      \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = f(a)
    </me>.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A vector-valued function is <term>continuous</term> if and
        only if each component function is continuous.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>derivative</term> of a vector valued function <m>f:
        A \rightarrow \RR^n</m> is calculated in each component.
        <me>
          \frac{df}{dt} = f^\prime(t) = \left( \frac{df_1}{dt},
          \frac{df_2}{dt}, \ldots, \frac{df_n}{dt} \right)
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        We state this explicitly, for <m>f(x) = (x(t),y(t))</m> with
        values in <m>\RR^2</m>.
        <me>
          f^\prime(t) = \frac{d}{dt} f(t) = \left( \frac{dx}{dt},
          \frac{dy}{dt}\right)
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise, we give the explicit form for <m>f(t) = (x(t),
        y(t),z(t))</m> with values in <m>\RR^3</m>.
        <me>
          f^\prime(t) = \frac{d}{dt} f(t) = \left( \frac{dx}{dt},
          \frac{dy}{dt}, \frac{dz}{dt} \right)
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    The result of a derivative of a vector valued function
    is still a vector. This may seem odd from the viewpoint of first
    year calculus, where derivatives measured
    quantifiable geometric properties, such as slopes of tangent
    lines.  Since the answers here are vectors
    instead of scalars, we will eventually reconsider those
    interpretations. A major challenge in extending calculus to
    several variables is the need to re-adjust our interpretation and
    intuition concerning derivatives (and eventually integrals). The
    derivative is no longer the slope of a tangent line.
