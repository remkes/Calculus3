  <title>The Dot Product</title>
  <p>
    Earlier we said that we can't multiply two vectors together.
    However, there are operations similar to multiplication.
    The following operation multiplies two vectors,
    but the result is a scalar instead of another vector.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>dot product</term> or
        <term>inner product</term>
        or <term>scalar product</term>
        of two vectors <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> is given by the following formula.
        <me>
          u \cdot v = \begin{pmatrix}u_1\\u_2\\\vdots\\u_n\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}v_1\\v_2\\\vdots\\v_n\end{pmatrix} = u_1 v_1 + u_2 v_2 + \ldots + u_n v_n
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    We can think of the dot product as a scalar measure of the similarity of direction between the two vectors.
    If the two vectors point in a similar direction,
    their dot product is large,
    but if they point in very different directions,
    their dot product is small.
    However, we already have a measure,
    at least in <m>\RR^2</m>, of this difference:
    the angle between two vectors.
    Thankfully, the two measures of difference agree and the dot product can be expressed in terms of angles.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>angle</term> <m>\theta</m> between two non-zero vectors <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> in <m>\RR^n</m> is given by the equation
        <me>
          \cos \theta = \frac{u \cdot v}{|u||v|}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        We assume the angle between any two vectors is <m>\theta \in [0, \pi]</m>.
        If <m>\theta > \pi</m>,
        then we can look at the other side of the angle to get something between <m>0</m> and <m>\pi</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    This definition matches with the definition of angles in <m>\RR^2</m> and <m>\RR^3</m>,
    which we can visualize.
    However, this serves as a new definition for angles between vectors in all <m>\RR^n</m> when <m>n \geq 4</m>.
    Since we can't visualize those spaces,
    we don't have a way of drawing angles and calculating them with conventional trigonometry.
    This definition allows us to extend angles in a completely algebraic way.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Two vectors <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> in <m>\RR^n</m> are called
        <term>orthogonal</term> or
        <term>perpendicular</term>
        or <term>normal</term> if <m>u \cdot v = 0</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Now that we have some operations,
    it is useful to see how the various operations interact.
    The following list shows some interactions between addition,
    scalar multiplication, length and the dot product.
    Some of these are easy to establish from the definition and some take more work.
  </p>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>u,v,w</m> be vectors in <m>\RR^n</m> and let <m>a</m> be a scalar in <m>\RR</m>.
        <men>
          \begin{array}{rll} u + v \amp  = v + u \amp  \hspace{1cm} \text{ Commutative Law for Vector Addition }  \\ a (u+v) \amp  = au + av \amp  \hspace{1cm} \text{ Distributive Law for Scalar Multiplication } \\ u \cdot v \amp  = v \cdot u \amp  \hspace{1cm} \text{ Commutative Law for the Dot Product } \\ u \cdot u \amp  = |u|^2 \amp  \\ u \cdot (v+w) \amp  = u \cdot v + u \cdot w \amp  \hspace{1cm} \text{ Distributive Law for the Dot Product } \\ u \cdot (av) \amp  = (au) \cdot v = a (u \cdot v) \\ |u+v| \amp  \leq |u| + |v| \amp  \hspace{1cm} \ \text{ Triangle Inequality }  \\ |au| \amp  = |a||u| \amp \end{array}
        </men>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <p>
    The last line deserves some attention for the notation.
    When we write <m>|a| |u|</m>,
    <m>|a|</m> is an absolute value of a real number and <m>|u|</m> is the length of a vector.
    The fact that they have the same notation is frustrating,
    but these notations are conventional.
