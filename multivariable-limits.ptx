    <title>Definition of Limits of Multivariable Functions</title>
    <p>
      We want to re-establish the tools of calculus for multi-variable
      functions. As with single-variable functions, our starting
      point is limits. Let's start with the full, formal,
      <m>\epsilon-\delta</m> definition.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m> be a function. Let
          <m>(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)</m> be a point in <m>\RR^n</m>.
          Then the statement
          <me>
            \lim_{(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) \rightarrow (a_1, a_2,
            \ldots, a_n)} f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = L
          </me>
          means that <m>\forall \epsilon > 0</m> <m>\exists \delta >
          0</m> such that if <m>|(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) - (a_1, a_2,
          \ldots, a_n)| \lt \delta</m> then <m>|f(x_1, x_2, \ldots,
          x_n) - L| \lt  \epsilon</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The definition is essentially the same as the single-variable
      definition: as the input gets closer and closer to a specific
      point, the output gets closer and closer to a fixed value
      <m>L</m>. The only issue is that <sq>closer and closer</sq> now
      happens in <m>\RR^n</m> instead of <m>\RR</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <m>\RR</m>, we only had two directions of approach: from the
      left and from the right. If the behaviour from both sides was
      the same, we said the limit existed. In <m>\RR^n</m> for <m>n
      \geq 2</m>, we have infinitely many ways to approach any given
      point. We can approach along lines in infinitely many
      directions out from the point. Even more, we can approach along
      other paths, such as spiral paths or stranger jagged paths.
      This makes it much more difficult to determine the behaviour and
      much more difficult to prove existence of various limits.
      However, we do have some good news. First, the definition of
      continuity remains the same.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m> is called
          continuous at <m>(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)</m> if the limit
          approaching <m>(a_1,a_2, \ldots, a_n)</m> exists and is the
          same as <m>f(a_1,a_2, \ldots, a_n)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      So limits for continuous functions are still reasonable: we just
      evaluate. But what functions are continuous?
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m> is continuous if
          and only if it is continuous independently in each of its
          variables.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      This is the first application of a very important technique:
      treating the function as a function of only one of the variables
      and ignoring the other, pretending that they are constant. If
      we do that, we get <m>n</m> different single variable functions.
      The proposition says that the function is continuous in the new
      definition if and only if all of the <m>n</m> different single
      variable functions are continuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      This proposition tells us how to recognize continuous functions.
      Anything involving polynomials, roots, rational functions, trig,
      exponentials and logarithms is continuous on its domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we mentioned before, proving the existence of limits is
      difficult. However, the algebraic techniques of first year
      calculus can still work for calculations. Here are some
      examples.

          This limit depend on the choice of <m>m</m>!  We can get
          infinitely many values (all between 0 and 1) out of this
          limit depending on which line we use to approach
          <m>(0,0)</m>. With all these possible answers, the limit
          cannot exist. It is interesting to try to visualize the
          graph: as we get close to zero, there are pieces of the
          graph getting close to any number between <m>0</m> and
          <m>1</m>. <xref ref="figure-3d-graph2">Figure</xref> shows
          some of this behaviour: approaching from the front of figure
          leads to <m>0</m>, but approaching from the sides leads to
          larger numbers. (The graph is slightly flawed, due to the
          graphing algorithm. The two cliffs should meet, even though
          the graph shows a gap between them. Where the two cliffs
          meet is the line with all the problematic limits.)

          In this example, we approach along parabolic paths of the
          form <m>x = m y^2</m> and, like the previous example, get a
          limit that depends on the path of approach.

          Sometime we can make reasonable conclusion independent of
          path.
          <me>
            \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (0,0)} \frac{\sin(x+y)}{x+y}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We can assume any path <m>y = f(x)</m> of approach and still
          set <m>u = x+y</m>, which turns this into a limit of
          <m>\sin(u)/u</m>, which tends to 1.
