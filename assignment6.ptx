        Find and classify (including local/global status) the critical
        points and extrema of the following functions. (Careful with
        domains.) (20)
        <ol>
          <li>
            <m>f(x,y) = xy + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y}</m> 
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>f(x,y) = x^2 - y^2 + xy</m>
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>f(x,y) = e^x \cos y</m>
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>f(x,y) = x + xy + y - x^2y^2</m>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Consider the function <m>f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - x^2y^2</m>.
        (10)
        <ol>
          <li>
            Draw a contour map for <m>f</m>. (Hint: look at the line
            for <m>f(x,y) = 1</m>, <m>f(x,y) = 0</m> and <m>f(x,y) =
            -1</m> first).
          </li>
          <li>
            Find all five extrema and/or saddle points.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you walked on a straight line through the unique
            minimum and two of the saddle points, moving at a constant
            speed in the <m>x-y</m> plane, what would be the rate of
            elevation loss or gain?
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Solve the following constrained optimization problems. (12)
        <ol>
          <li>
            Minimize <m>x^2 + 3y^2</m> on the line <m>x + y = 4</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Maximize <m>x^2 + y^2 +z^2</m> on the locus <m>x^3 + y^3 =
            z</m>.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        If temperature is given as <m>T(x,y) = Ae^{-(x^2 + y^2)}</m>
        over points in the <m>x,y</m> plane, and elevation is
        <m>H(x,y) = \frac{10}{(x+1)^2 + y^2 + 4}</m>, then what is the
        maximum temperature at a height of <m>1</m>?  (Hint: make an
        argument for maximizing a simplier function before starting).
        (6)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        What intersection point(s) of the plane <m>x + y + z = 2</m>
        and the sphere <m>x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9</m> is(are) farthest
        from the origin? (6)
