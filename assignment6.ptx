        Find the equations of the tangent planes to the following
        functions at the specified points. (12)
        <ol>
          <li>
            <m>f(x,y) = y \ln x</m> at <m>(1,4,0)</m>
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>f(x,y) = x^2 - y^2</m> at <m>(2,-2,0)</m>
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>f(x,y) = \frac{1}{x-y}</m> at <m>(3,2,1)</m>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Consider the function <m>f(x,y) = -(x^2 + y^2) + 4</m>. Where
        does the graph of this function intersect with the sphere or
        radius <m>4</m>?  Is the tangent plane at any of those points
        also tangent to the sphere? (8)
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
        Find and classify (including local/global status) the critical
        points and extrema of the following functions. (Careful with
        domains.) (20)
        <ol>
          <li>
            <m>f(x,y) = xy + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y}</m> 
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>f(x,y) = x^2 - y^2 + xy</m>
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>f(x,y) = e^x \cos y</m>
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>f(x,y) = x + xy + y - x^2y^2</m>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Consider the function <m>f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - x^2y^2</m>.
        (10)
        <ol>
          <li>
            Draw a contour map for <m>f</m>. (Hint: look at the line
            for <m>f(x,y) = 1</m>, <m>f(x,y) = 0</m> and <m>f(x,y) =
            -1</m> first).
          </li>
          <li>
            Find all five extrema and/or saddle points.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you walked on a straight line through the unique
            minimum and two of the saddle points, moving at a constant
            speed in the <m>x-y</m> plane, what would be the rate of
            elevation loss or gain?
          </li>
