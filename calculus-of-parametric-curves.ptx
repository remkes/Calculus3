    <p>
      Parametric curves are vector-valued functions,
      so they have derivatives as defined earlier.
      Since we consider parametric curves as motion through <m>\RR^n</m>,
      the derivative has a related interpretation.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\gamma(t): [a,b] \rightarrow \RR^n</m> be a parametric curve.
          Its derivative <m>\gamma^\prime(t)</m> is called the
          <term>tangent vector</term> to the parametric curve.
        </p>
      </statement>

    <p>
      This tangent is no longer the slope of a tangent line from single-variable claculus.
      It is a vector,
      which we treat as a local direction vector along the curve.
      At <m>\gamma(a)</m>,
      <m>\gamma^\prime(a)</m> points in the local direction of movement.
      The notion of a derivative as a tangent direction replaces old notion of the derivative as the slope of the tangent line.

          Consider the logarithmic spiral
          <m>\gamma(t) = (e^{\frac{t}{4}}\sin t, e^{\frac{t}{4}}\cos t)</m> on the domain <m>t \in \RR</m>.
          We calculate its derivative.

          Evaluating at <m>t=0</m> at the point of the curve <m>\gamma(0) = (0,1)</m>,
          the derivative or tangent vector to the curve is <m>\gamma^\prime(0) = (1,\frac{1}{4})</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This spiral is moving outwards;
          we can see how the tangent vector points in the direction of movement as the curves goes through <m>(0,1)</m>.
          <xref ref="figure-logarithmic-spiral-tangent">Figure</xref>
          shows how we treat the tangent as a local direction vector:
          it points from <m>\gamma(0) = (0,1)</m>, not from the origin.

          All of these tangent vectors are multiples of the vector <m>(1,2)</m>,
          but they have different lengths,
          as seen in <xref ref="figure-tangent-lengths">Figure</xref>.

      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      We said the tangent vector indicated the instantaneous direction of motion.
      The tangent vector also has a length,
      independent of the direction.
      The length of the tangent vector measures the speed of the curve going through that point.
      If the movement along the curve is very fast,
      the tangent vector will have a large length;
      if the movement along the curve is slow,
      the tangent vector will be shorter.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the parametrizations of the graph of the parabolic,
      we can see that the direction of the tangent is independent of the parametrization,
      but the length of the tangent is entirely dependent on the parametrization.
      The parametrization which move more quickly along the curve have longer tangents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often it is useful to only consider the tangent direction.

          If <m>\gamma^\prime(t)</m> is the tangent vector of a parametric curve,
          the <term>unit tangent vector</term>
          is the unique vector of length one in the same direction as <m>\gamma^\prime(t)</m>.
          It is often written <m>T(t)</m>.
          To calculate the unit tangent,
          we simply take the tangent vector and divide by its length.
          <me>
            T(t) = \frac{\gamma^\prime(t)}{|\gamma^\prime(t)|}
          </me>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          In the logarithmic spiral,
          the tangent vector was <m>\gamma^\prime(0) = (1, \frac{1}{4})</m>.
          We calculate the length of this vector.
          <me>
            \left|\left(1,\frac{1}{4}\right)\right| = \sqrt{ 1 + \frac{1}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{17}}{4}

        <p>
          Then we can calculate the unit tangent.
          <me>
            T(t) = \frac{\gamma^\prime(t)}{|\gamma^\prime(t)|} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{17}}\left( 1, \frac{1}{4} \right) = \left( \frac{4}{\sqrt{17}},\frac{1}{\sqrt{17}} \right)

    <title>Tangents in Non-Linear Coordinates</title>
    <p>
      Tangents are a Cartesian notion.
      If our curve is given in a different coordinate systems,
      we still want the word <sq>tangent</sq> to mean the Cartesian tangent.
      Cartesian tangents cary the interepretation we want:
      the direction of motion.
      Therefore, to find tangent in other coordinate systems,
      we relate them back to Cartesian coordinates.
      In polar coordinates, we have
      <m>x = r \cos \theta</m> and <m>y = r \sin \theta</m>.
      If <m>r</m> and <m>\theta</m> depend on <m>t</m>,
      then we can differentiation these expressions using the product rule.

  <subsection xml:id="arclength-and-tangents">
    <title>Arclength and Tangents</title>
    <p>
      There are some very natural connections between tangents and arclength which relate to the intepretation of parametric curves as movement through space.
      Let's return to the arc length formula
      (in <m>\RR^2</m>, for simplicity).
      <me>
        L = \int_a^b \sqrt{x^\prime(t)^2 + y^\prime(t)^2} dt
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The tangent vector is <m>\gamma^\prime(t) = (x^\prime(t),
      y^\prime(t))</m>,
      so this integrand in the arclength formula is nothing more than the length of the tangent vector.
      This lets us rewrite the arclength formula.
      <me>
        L = \int_a^b |\gamma^\prime(t)| dt
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This hopefully makes intuitive sense <mdash/> the length of the tangent vector measures the speed of the curve.
      To get length
      (the distance travelled),
      we integrate the speed of movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      An nice event occurs when we differentiate the arclength function <m>s(t)</m>.
      The fundamental theorem of calculus allows us to differentiate an integral.
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dt} s(t) = \frac{d}{dt} \int_a^t |\gamma^\prime(u)| du = |\gamma^\prime (t)|
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The derivative of the arclength function is the length of the tangent vector,
      which represents the speed of movement along the curve.
      To get speed, we differentiate length.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both of these observations generalize the relationship between distance and speed from single variable calculus.
      In that forum, the relationship was relatively direct:
      if <m>d(t)</m> was distance,
      then <m>d^\prime(t)</m> was speed and if <m>v(t)</m> was speed then <m>\int v(t) dt</m> was distance.
      The idea here is exactly the same,
      but since the movement is much more complicated,
      going through multi-dimensional space,
      we need more complicated definitions and notations to access the idea.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Recall the parametrization by arclength of the helix in <m>\RR^3</m> in <xref ref="example-helix-reparametrized">Example</xref>.
          <me>
            \gamma(s) = \left( 2 \cos \left( \frac{s}{\sqrt{20}} \right), 2 \sin \left( \frac{s}{\sqrt{20}} \right), \frac{4s}{\sqrt{20}} \right)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's calculate the speed in this parametrization by arclength.
          <m>|\gamma^\prime(s)|</m>:
          <md>
            <mrow>|\gamma^\prime(s)| \amp  = \sqrt{ x^\prime(s)^2 + y^\prime(s)^2 + z^\prime(s)^2}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{-2}{\sqrt{20}} \sin \left( \frac{s}{\sqrt{20}} \right) \right)^2 + \left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{20}} \cos \left( \frac{s}{\sqrt{20}} \right) \right)^2 + \left( \frac{4}{\sqrt{20}} \right)^2}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  = \sqrt{\frac{4}{20} \left( \cos^2 \left( \frac{5}{\sqrt{20}} \right) + \sin^2 \left( \frac{5}{\sqrt{20}} \right) \right) + \frac{16}{20} } = \sqrt{ \frac{4}{20} + \frac{16}{20}} = 1</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          We find that the speed is constantly one.
          This turns out to be generally true.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\gamma(t): [a,b] \rightarrow \RR^n</m> be a parametric curve.
          Our of all the possible reparametrizations of <m>\gamma</m>,
          the parametrization by arclength has three properties.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                It is the unique parametrization with constant speed of 1.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                It is the unique parametrization where all tangent vectors have length 1.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                It is the unique parametrization where the parameter measures distance along the curve.

            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      These properties are very useful and convenient.
      In the remainder of this chapter,
      we will make frequent use of the parametrization by arclength;
      it serves as our default parametrization.
      We can do this since the parametrization by arclength always exists and is unique.
      Having a special,
      default parameter allows us to make good definitions which will be independent of the choice of parametrization. (In practice,
      the parametrization by arclength can be extremely difficult to actually calculate.
      For theoretical results, however,
      this difficulty isn't relevant).

    <title>Curvature and Torsion</title>
    <p>
      The tangent vector for a parametric curve measures the speed and direction of movement along the curve.
      Speed and direction are good information,
      but not enough to complete describe motion in multiple dimensions.
      In particular,
      the tangent vector gives the direction but doesn't say how direction is changing.
      This section builds up the notions of curvature and torsion,
      which will complete a full description of th echanging directions of movement.
      In this section, we exclusively work in <m>\RR^3</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <m>\RR^3</m>, I want to classify three types of movement.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Straight motion: the direction is fixed and only speed varies.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Curving motion in a plane: motion is fixed to a plane,
            but the direction can change and curve in the plane.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Twisting motion: the most general motion,
            where in addition to curving in a plane,
            we can also twist away from the plane.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout this section,
      let <m>\gamma(t): [a,b] \rightarrow \RR^3</m> be a curve in three dimensions.
      Recall we already have the tangent
      <m>\gamma^\prime(t)</m> and the unit tangent <m>T(t)</m>.
      If the curve is parametrized by arc length,
      we will use the parameter <m>s</m> and write <m>\gamma(s)</m>.
      In this case, the tangent is already a unit vector,
      so <m>T(s) = \gamma^\prime(s)</m>.
      We will usually start our definition using the parmetrization by arclength,
      to ensure they are independent of parametrizations.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>curvature</term> of <m>\gamma(s)</m> is a scalar
          <m>\kappa(s)</m> which measure how quickly the curve is turning.
          <me>
            \kappa(s) = \left| \frac{dT(s)}{ds} \right|
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      We can think of turning as a change in the direction of the unit tangent <m>T(s)</m>.
      It is a scalar,
      not showing the new direction but just the magnitude of the change.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a couple things to note about this definition.
      First, <m>\kappa</m> is the greek letter kappa,
      even though it looks like our <sq>k</sq>.
      Second, <m>T(s)</m> is a vector,
      so the derivative <m>\frac{dT(s)}{ds}</m> is a vector derivative <mdash/> the derivative is taken in each component of the vector.
      Curvature is the scalar length of the resulting vector.
    </p>
    <p>
      The given definition of curvatuve only works for parametrization by arclength.
      We would like to calculate <m>\kappa</m> in terms of an arbitrary parameter <m>t</m>,
      since arclength can be difficult to work with.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\gamma(t)</m> be a parametric curve with an arbitrary parametrization.
          The curvature <m>\kappa(t)</m> can be calculated in this arbitrary parametrization.

            \kappa(t) = \frac{|T^\prime(t)|}{|\gamma^\prime(t)|}

    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We have the arclength function <m>s(t)</m>.
        The chain rule gives the derivative in a general form.
        <me>
          \frac{dT(t)}{dt} = \frac{dT(s(t))}{ds} \frac{ds}{dt}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        We can rearrange this equation and then take the lengths of the vectors.
        <me>
          \frac{dT}{ds} = \frac{\frac{dT}{dt}}{\frac{ds}{dt}} \implies \left| \frac{dT}{ds} \right| = \left| \frac{\frac{dT}{dt}}{\frac{ds}{dt}} \right| \implies \left| \frac{dT}{ds} \right| = \frac{\left|\frac{dT}{dt}\right|}{\left|\frac{ds}{dt}\right|}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        The left hand side of this expression is exactly <m>\kappa</m>,
        the curvature.
        The numerator on the right hand side can be written <m>|T^\prime(t)|</m>,
        the change in the unit tangent for an arbitrary parametrization.
        The denominator <m>\left| \frac{ds}{dt} \right|</m> is just the length of the tangent vector <m>|\gamma^\prime(t)|</m>.

          Again unsurprisingly, the unit circle has constant curvature of one;
          we would expect uniform curvate for a circle.
          This also give a reference for the scale of curvature:
          curvature of one is exactly the curvature of the unit circle.

          A similar calcluation can be done for the circle of radius <m>a</m>,
          which is <m>\gamma(t) = (a \cos t, a \sin t)</m>.
          If we repeat all the steps for the unit circle,
          we get <m>\kappa(t) = \frac{1}{a}</m>.
          Again, this is constant,
          which makes sense since the circle is equally curved at all points.
          However, it's interesting to note that the curvature is <em>inversely</em>
          proportional to the radius.
          A curvature value of <m>\kappa</m> is interpreted as the curvature of a circle of radius <m>\frac{1}{\kappa}</m>.

          This hopefully makes sense <mdash/> a circle with a very large radius doesn't locally have to curve very much.
          We know this very well, living on the surface of the earth:
          since the radius of the earth is large,
          we don't really see the curvature of its surface.
          However, for circle with very small radius,
          there is less distance to cover a whole revolution,
          so the curvature must be larger.

      To complete the description of motion in <m>\RR^3</m>,
      we define the normal and binormal vectors.
      I apologies, on behalf of mathematicians everywhere,
      for the use of the word <sq>normal</sq> in this definition (and,

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\gamma(t)</m> be a differential parametric curve such that
          <m>|\gamma(t)| = 1</m> for all <m>t</m> in the domain of the curve. (That is,
          <m>\gamma(t)</m> is always a unit vector.) Then <m>\gamma</m> is perpendicular to its derivative.

            \gamma(t) \cdot \gamma^\prime(t) = 0

    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Since <m>\gamma(t)</m> is always a unit vector,
        the path of <m>\gamma(t)</m> is a path on the unit sphere in <m>\RR^3</m>.
        The tangent direction of this path, therefore,
        must be a tangent to the unit sphere.
        Unit vector point directly out of the unit sphere;
        they are perpendicular to tangent vectors of the unit sphere.
        Therefore, <m>\gamma</m> and
        <m>\gamma^\prime</m> must be perpendicular vectors.

      The cross product of two vectors is perpedicular to both,

      <m>N</m> and <m>B</m> are perpendicular to each other.
      In addition,
      <m>T</m> was already a unit vector and <m>N</m> was defined explicitly as a unit vector.
      The cross product of two perpendicular unit vectors is also a unit vectors,

      Let's complete these definitions with interpretation.
      We've already spent some time on the unit tangent vector <m>T(t)</m>.
      It represents the direction of movement of the curve at that point.
      The associated scalar is speed,
      measuring how fast the object is moving at this point in the curve.
      The normal vector <m>N(t)</m> represents the direction of curvature.
      Curvature was a scalar, measuring how curved the curve is at this point.
      The normal vector adds to this scalar a direction,
      telling you which way the curve is turning.
      The two vectors <m>T</m> and <m>N</m> determine a plane.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The plane determined by <m>T</m> and <m>N</m>is called the
          <term>osculating plane</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      If a parametric curve isn't twisted,
      the osculating plane is the plane on which the curve travels.
      The binormal vector <m>B(t)</m> is perpendicular to the osculating plane.
      Since planes are best described by their normals,
      we use <m>B(t)</m> to keep track of the osculating plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our third type of movement was twisting movement,
      where we allowed a curve path to twist away from its plane of movement.
      Since the osculating plane is determined by its normal <m>B(t)</m>,
      twisting motion involves the change in <m>B(t)</m>.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\gamma(s): [0,L] \rightarrow \RR^3</m> be a parametric curve parametrized by arclength.
          Its <term>torsion</term> is written <m>\tau(s)</m> and defined by the formula
          <me>
            \tau(s) = \left| \frac{d B(s)}{ds} \right|
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Torsion is a scalar that measures the change in <m>B</m>,
      the change in the normal of the osculating plane.
      It meausre the rate of twisting,
      the tendency of curving paths to change their plane of motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with curvature,
      we want to calculate torsion in an arbitrary parametrization.

        <p>
          Let <m>\gamma(t): [a,b] \rightarrow \RR</m> be a parametric curve in an arbitrary parametrization.
          Then its torsion is calculabed by the formula
          <me>
            \tau(t) = \frac{-1}{|\gamma^\prime(t)|} B^\prime(t) \cdot N(t)
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        The arclength parameter is related to the parameter <m>t</m> by the arlencth function <m>s = s(t)</m>.
        The chain rule calculates the derivative of the binormal vector.
        <me>
          \frac{dB(t)}{dt} = \frac{dB(t(s))}{ds} \frac{ds}{dt}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        We can rearrange this expression.
        <me>
          \frac{dB(s)}{ds} = \frac{\frac{dB(t)}{dt}}{\frac{dt}{ds}} = \frac{B^\prime(t)}{|\gamma^\prime(t)|}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Without proof,
        <m>B^\prime(t)</m> points in the direction of the negative of the normal,
        <m>-N(t)</m>.
        To get the torsion,
        which is the length of the vector in the previous formula,
        we can take the dot product with the unit vector in this direction,
        which is simply <m>-N(t)</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      Now we have three scalars (speed, curvature,
      torsion) and three matching vectors
      (tangent, normal and binormal).
      Together, this information completely describes motion in <m>\RR^3</m>.
      For convenience,
      the next list collects the definitions of all six of these mathematical objects.
