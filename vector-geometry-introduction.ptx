  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>
    The use of vectors is common in many branches of mathematics.
    Physically, vectors are motivated by the need to identify points and directions in three-dimensional space.
    However, the physical motivation is only one among many motivations for vectors.
    This chapter aims to give a relatively brief introduction to vector algebra.
    The material is abrieviated from the Linear Algebra course,
    where vectors are a core topic and are investigated in full detail.
    Practically,
    this chapter aims to be sufficient for the needs of vector calculus.
