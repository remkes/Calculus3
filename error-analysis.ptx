  <title>Error Analysis of Series</title>
  <p>
    When we truncate a series to get a Taylor polynomial, we obviously
    change the function. But how much have we changed it? This
    change is called the error of the Taylor polynomial, so we ask:
    what is the error introduced by truncating an infinite series?
    The study of approximations in mathematics is all about
    understanding and controlling error.
  </p>
  <p>
    For Taylor series, there is a theorem that controls the error of
    Taylor polynomial approximation. This is sometimes called
    Taylor's Theorem or the Lagrange Error Bound.
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f</m> be analytic at <m>\alpha</m> with a positive
        radius of convergence <m>R</m> and let <m>d \in \RR</m> with
        <m>0\lt d\lt R</m>. Let <m>M \in \RR_{> 0}</m> such that on
        the interval <m>(\alpha-d, \alpha+d)</m> we have
        <me>
          |f^{k+1}(x)| \leq M
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The error of the <m>k</m>th Taylor polynomial approximation
        can be written as
        <me>
          R_k = f - \sum_{n=0}^k c_n (x-\alpha)^n =
          \sum_{n=k+1}^\infty c_n (x-\alpha)^n
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under all these assumptions, the error satisfies an
        inequality.
        <me>
          |R_k(x)| \leq \frac{M}{(k+1)!} |x-\alpha|^{k+1}
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    This is a difficult theorem to understand. The basic idea is that
    there exists a balance between three pieces: the order of the
    approximation, the width of the interval, and the size of the
    error. Higher order approximations are more accurate, but they
    are also computationally more difficult; to work on computers, we
    want to use a higher enough order to be accurate, but a low enough
    order to allow the computer to finish the calculation quickly.
    Likewise, a small interval minimizes the error, since error tends
    to be larger the farther we move away from the centre of the
    series. We would like to work with a large interval, since it
    means that one series works for many difficult calculations, but
    we may not have the accuracy we desire on a large interval. To
    summarize: we want a low order, a large interval and a small
    error, but it is difficult to achieve all three. Sometimes, one
    is sacrificed for the others.

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider <m>f(x) = \sin x</m>. We can take <m>M=1</m>, since
        the derivatives of <m>\sin x</m> are <m>\pm \sin x</m> and
        <m>\pm \cos x</m>, all of which are bounded in absolutely
        value by <m>1</m>. Then we can ask: what order do we need in
        order to have <m>\frac{1}{10000}</m> precision on
        <m>(-10,10)</m>? The error calculation looks like:
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \frac{M}{(n+1)!} |x|^{n+1} \amp \leq \frac{1}{10^4}
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            \frac{1}{(n+1)!} |10|^{n+1} \amp \leq \frac{1}{10^4}
          </mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is actually quite difficult to solve for <m>n</m>.
        However, we can try some <m>n</m>. Here are some values for
        <m>n</m> and the error bound:
        <me>
          \begin{array}{*4{>{\displaystyle}l}} 
            n=5 \amp |R_5(x)| \leq \frac{12500}{9} \amp n=10 \amp
              |R_{10}(x)| \leq \frac{15625000}{6237} \\
            n=15 \amp |R_{15}(x)| \leq 477 \amp n=18 \amp |R_{18}(x)|
              \leq 82.3 \\
            n=20 \amp |R_{20}(x)| \leq 19.6 \amp n=22 \amp |R_{22}(x)|
              \leq 3.87 \\ 
            n=24 \amp |R_{24}(x)| \leq 0.645 \amp n=26 \amp |R_{26}(x)| \leq
              0.0919 \\ 
            n=28 \amp |R_{28}(x)| \leq 0.0114 \amp n=30 \amp
              |R_{30}(x)| \leq 0.00122 \\
            n=31 \amp |R_{31}(x)| \leq 0.000381 \amp n=32 \amp
              |R_{32}(x)| \leq 0.000116 \\
            n=33 \amp |R_{33}(x)| \leq 0.0000339 \amp \amp 
          \end{array}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        So, finally, when <m>n=33</m> we have the desired accuracy.
        We need an order <m>33</m> polynomial to achieve the desired
        precision on the desired interval.
      </p>
      <p>
        What about smaller intervals? Say we only need the interval
        <m>\left( \frac{-1}{10}, \frac{1}{10} \right)</m>. Let's see
        how accurate various orders are on this interval.
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \amp n=5 \amp \amp |R_5(x)| \leq 1.39 \times 10^{-9}
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            \amp n=10 \amp \amp |R_{10}(x)| \leq 2.51 \times
            10^{-19}
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            \amp n=15 \amp \amp |R_{15}(x)| \leq 4.78 \times
            10^{-30}
          </mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is much easier to be precise on this smaller interval.
      </p>

        Consider the function <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}</m> on
        <m>(\frac{-1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})</m>. Look at the pattern of
        derivatives.
        <me>
          f^{(n)}(x) = \frac{n!}{(1-x)^{n+1}}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>M</m> bounds the <m>n+1</m>st derivative, and the
        derivatives are increasing functions, so they are maximized at
        <m>x = \frac{1}{2}</m>. This lets us calculate <m>M</m>.
        <me>
          M = \frac{(n+1)!}{(1-\frac{1}{2})^{n+2}} = 2^{n+2}(n+1)!
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        We apply the inequality in the Lagrange Error Bound.
        <me>
          R_n \leq \frac{M}{(n+1)!}d^{n+1} =
          \frac{2^{n+2}(n+1)!}{(n+1)!} \left( \frac{1}{2}
          \right)^{n+1} = 2
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is entirely inconclusive, for any order, showing the
        potential limitations of the Lagrange Error Bound; sometimes,
        other methdos are required for special situation. For this
        example, we must work directly with the series to determine
        its accuracy. Here is a direct calculation of a bound for the
        error.
        <md>
          <mrow>
            R_n \amp = \sum_{k=n+1}^\infty x^k \leq
            \sum_{k=n+1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^k =
            \sum_{k=n+1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{k-n-1}
            \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{n+1}
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            \amp = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{n+1}
            \sum_{k=n+1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{k-n-1} =
            \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{n+1} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \left(
            \frac{1}{2} \right)^{k} = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{n+1}
            \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{2}}
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            \amp = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{n+1} 2 = \frac{1}{2^n}
          </mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        So the error of the <m>n</m>th order can be bounded by
        <m>\frac{1}{2^n}</m>. For <m>n=10</m>, that is less than a
        thousandth. For <m>n=20</m>, less than a millionth, and so
        on.
